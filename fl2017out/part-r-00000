0090F7	7	positive	 In general I like doing homework The implementation parts are very interesting However the theoretical questions are boring particularly question I would prefer to have more implementation exercises rather than keep looking at the slides to answer the theoretical questions Besides question helps me a lot to understand how to do mapreduce for collaborative filtering 
025982	8	positive	 This homework was one of the better ones I think Problem was pretty clear and I think I was more comfortable with Spark afterward Problem was alright as well and I m thankful the little XML parsing stubs were written for us The writing in b is a little confusing An excerpt from the desired RDD would make it a little clearer what the problem is asking but I think I got it alright Problem was fine as well although it seems to me to be I am still unsure where operation in b refers to the general operations map filter count etc or specific instances of these operations where map is called with a particular function which I think may also be called operations 
02B9A0	8	positive	 This was another interesting homework to perform As being one that is familiar with python it was pleasing to be able to work with a python format to perform MapReduce rather than through Java Utilizing Spark also makes it much easier to debug jobs without all of the overhead It was also fun playing with the RDDs to perform transformations and mapping jobs and learning some of the features of Spark 
02D8D9	6	neutral	 This week is a busy week with mid term exams Spend at around hours on this week s homework including the lab part I have to look up slides from lectures before to help figure out how to transfer the movie id number to the movie name This is the most difficult part in this homework  Always have lot of work to do after class  
034CDF	2	neutral	 Homework was similar to homework in that it was very straightforward The questions were fairly easy to answer and there was not much ambiguity I understand that we need to learn the concepts but these questions seem to me to be overly simplistic More questions about types of mappers or reducers or implementing simple ones would be more instructive Perhaps that is to come in the next homework 
0433AE	5	positive	 Like most of the other previous homework assignments this one was not too bad as there are several examples discussed in class and previous labs that give hints as the how to implement the MapReduce pipeline As discussed in class the Mapper s needed to be implemented are fairly simple and short programs The Reducer was the same SuMReducer from the previous wordcount assignment I liked that there was a good amount of conceptual questions as well that make one think about what is going on under the hood when writing and running the programs we ve been assigned to implement 
05B530	5	positive	 This homework is quite involved in the knowledge outside of coding We had to look up a bunch of earlier lectures which is good I supposed I have another exam this week so I ll take advantage of the late day policy  Problem is going to be challenging I know I m going to have a good time 
06D018	8	negative	 I thought this homework was particularly difficult I didn t mind problem or but i thought that problem was a little out of my range of knowledge considering what I ve learned in class I was a little confused about what problem was asking us to do but eventually we figured it out after doing some research Overall I feel as though the homeworks have been getting significantly harder 
0818A0	9	negative	 This was a very long homework and should be reduced in scope Usually when classes have exam they do not given double homework to compensate It s not fair to pass off the first two questions as studying for the exam This should have been weighted double a normal homework based on the time I spent on this 
083D08	9	negative	 This homework was bit lengthy It was good in terms of exam preparation but overall it involved lot of work I wish it could have been shortened a little bit I am not sure if I am the only only feeling this way or others in the class also have same opinion  
08F612	4	positive	 I think this time I spent lots of time of debugging And each small question will cause the final result The class document gave me really good induction and the question on Piazza will help me when I met same problem But this time I do not set the timetable right next time I will start it as soon as possible 
09CE15	7	positive	 This homework is a great homework for us to complete First we have the chance to review the basic knowledge of MapReduce and complete the InvertedIndex job we learn how to get the file name from the value from this problem Next we did some concept exercise for the collaborative filtering by computing the cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity It is also useful for us to understand the basic concept of this method 
0A301D	7	negative	 This homework is not that hard to complete but i confused that for the last question why we use the cosine similarity to compute the similarity of movies pairs Because for the movie only one user gave grade on it so for movie the other movie with it only have two condition similarities or We can t judge anything fromn that kind of data Is that means if the numberof users are too small the item item similarity is not as good as user user similarity Just if we use normalized cosine similarity the result will not change any more 
0B2E6E	3	neutral	 This homework had was somewhat similar to the previous homeworks It made it easier to know what sort of answers to write for the questions Many of the questions covered job execution which we talked about a lot in class This made the homework easier to work through somewhat It was a bit difficult however trying to understand how skew works I struggled a bit trying to figure out what the difference between reducers reduce tasks and reduce functions each referred to I think there were some inconsitencies in the slides and the textbook that made these questions confusing Besides these questions the rest of the homework was moderate in difficulty 
0DD66A	6	positive	 This homework comprehensively inspects the ability to implement MapReduce program from scratch It is fairly challenging compared with previous ones It requires the students to be familiar with every detail of the driver mapper and reducer codes taught in class and be efficient in terms of debugging The combiner problem strengthens the understanding of optimization techniques in MapReduce This homework is a good combination in a nutshell 
0FFDE2	7	positive	 I thought that this homework had a good combination of abstract concepts and physical coding I really enjoyed learning about the more in depth differences between user user similarity and item item similarity I thought that writing the mapreduce job to produce the inverted index could have been a little clearer as a got stuck a couple of times where I didn t really know the material from class Overall I thought this was a good homework that covered our material quite well 
10876C	6	negative	 This homework was somewhat complicated in that we had to implement two different jobs which means two mappers two reducers and two drivers It was very confusing when trying to match the types of the key and value outputs for the mappers and reducers At first try I didn t get this correct and took some time to debug Once the implementation was done and I had the whole output for the whole dataset answering the questions to the homework was not too bad 
10E9ED	1	positive	 I enjoyed the homework and especially appreciated the fact that it involved reading external materials I had a slightly harder time with Bonferroni s Principle because it s been a while since my probabiliy and statistics class I m excited to see what the Sentiment Analysis will look like at the end of the semester 
120A91	8	positive	 This is a light loaded homework that I can fully understood the materials covered by the topic of Spark  Comparing to Hadoop MapReduce task Spark is more handy and efficient Complex work in Hadoop can be done  in few minutes in Spark even if the users have limited programming backgroung The constrution of RDD is  also pretty creative 
12A42D	5	positive	 I really enjoy this time homework The code I can handle it more comfortable and when I saw the result process bar it is really existing for me to see that And the data was processed so amazing But I think I still improve and learn more like how to solve the special characters in poems       
138511	9	negative	 This homework was terrible Straight horrendous Not only was it freakishly long but it was also freakishly hard I am looking forward and so glad to almost be done with this class but we still have to do the makeup homework because we screwed up one of the homework terribly 
138E1E	3	negative	 I feel like this homework assignment was relatively straightforward All of the needed information was in the slides so I guess I felt confident about those answers It all seemed somewhat relevant though I wish we could actually do stuff instead of just talking about how it all works on a high level It would be nice to be able to interact with an actual Hadoop cluster in a way that makes it so all of this content actually matters as opposed to just memorizing information about Hadoop 
13B5F2	5	positive	 Overall I m happy with this homework The implementations are not too hard They seem to be more straightforward versions of the last homework I definitely took me quit some time to finish the homework I had to move my whole virtual machine to an external hard drive before starting this homework and many of my previous work was gone which is pretty frustrating I m hoping for some questions there can be more elaborations I literally had no idea what input splits means in the question Or it should at least be covered and discussed in the class 
14320F	6	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to use the use of combiner and partitioner in mapreduce jobs which can orgnise the result of mapper to save memory or call several reducers And I also got more familiar to the design and implement of the combiner and partitioner and their working theory 
14FDFF	4	neutral	 This assignment took a little longer than I had anticipated I just barely met the deadline this time having to use a couple extra days to finish it It was both frustrating and stressful to complete this one as I got stuck a few times However it was much more rewarding once everything was working properly and I recieved what I believe to be proper results I will definitely try to allot myself more time for the next assignment 
15047C	8	positive	 Homework requires less work than the previous one It is just some exploration on Spark But it do help us understand the functionality of Spark It is more user friendly than hadoop and do jobs much more faster Though it is a little tricky for programming with python since I did not use this language before it is a great experience for me to do this homework 
1601FD	4	positive	 Finally we get a practical coding homework It is much fun dancing with codes instead of just writing answers It is helpful for me to understand more about the Partitioner and ToolRunner Though it takes more time to finish this homework I m still glad to do more programming This is certainly an important start for this course 
1677DB	7	positive	 The homework could have been more clear on problem but I think that s more of a problem with the math I can t envision cosine similarity where you find the similarity between a non zero vector with a zero vector Thus I don t really think I understood the point of doing the dual approach when it doesn t really tell us any more than what we already know It gives the similarities between items but I fail to understand how why it can fill missing values in the utility matrix The rest of the homework was fine it was just problem that confused me I think I should go look over the math again maybe 
185EE0	7	negative	 I found this homework to be quite difficult I read the required test quite many times to get a clue but it was not very helpful My partner had to help me out to get us through this homework I dont know if it was only me or other in the class also faced it but it was unusually tough one for me at least Hopefully it will get better going forward  
189B9D	2	positive	 This homework was not too bad I should have started a little bit earlier A lot of the questions could be done with info found in the slides but some of it necessitated google searches I hope future homework are more similar to this one as it was not so bad 
1B4145	6	positive	 I thoroughly enjoyed completing this homework It provided a lot of freedom and opportunity to go through the whole development process for a MapReduce job on my own In addition it provided a real world application and showed how important the work we are doing is I feel confident that I can create a bit more complex MapReduce programs than I could in the past I am excited for the upcoming labs and homeworks that this class provides since everything from here on out will be an opportunity to confidently demonstrate my skills This homework definitely provided the opportunity to build that confidence 
1B52AE	1	neutral	 The first problem is somewhat easy to get Basically those are what we are mentioned in class  The second problem is a bit complicated becasue you need to be careful when checking the formulas The good part is we can find an example although simplified from textbook That saves my life  The third problem is dull and as it said unreasonable Granted I like the fact it reveals It tries to hide that simple notion Model Sucks go for more Data Seriously a student with no background of ML and NLP may have a hard time find the key idea of this article 
1D5C3E	2	positive	 Similarly with the first hw assignment I think exercises like these are very effective in a sense that it requires the answers to be well thought out and well explained unlike the usual coding extensive assignments given in other CSE classes I feel more confident in the future of this course as I believe that me and my partner is off to a good start 
1E12E4	5	positive	 Alright Getting into some good stuff now While the implementation of both of these were pretty straightforward I am encourage by actually getting to write some code The word co occurrence stuff is pretty interesting Sentiment analysis can clearly get very complicated quickly Coming from a finance background the sentiment analysis driven trading is interesting Knowing more about how this is actually being accomplished gives me pause potentially about how they are currently going about it and hope that they are using more involved algos than pair analysis 
1E7E6B	7	neutral	 The inverted index implementation was a more real life application of using Map Reduce at large scale The index would be the basis of additional text mining algorithms Normalization is an important part of collaborative filtering It really makes a difference in the cosine angle and the direction of Pearson The effect of positive vs negative is a more accurate representation of user ratings The item item utility matrix also improves the effectiveness of collaborative filtering 
1EAFF0	3	negative	 good home work I like the question  of this homework because they make me know how to use Map reduce the data size more clearly I like to combine the knowledge and code or I would use code or program to implement the theory And question one makes me fully understand the theory of how to use data node and name node as well as the relationship of them 
22B1E0	9	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to the use of PIG and Spark This homework give us a good chance to use the big data tools learnt in class by ourselves to deal with some real problems help us learn the techniques in particular 
236573	1	positive	 I think this homework is great It has less code work for us to complete however it let us know the basic knowledge of the property of big data and its applications by the means of reading and calculating So it is a good and interesting homework for our beginners to complete 
241E93	2	positive	 This homework leads us to read the book related to hadoop and let us review the concepts and commands of Distributed Storage and MapReduce of hadoop Based on the plentiful reading material of hadoop and some mathematic models of MapReduce method I think it is a great homework for us to complete 
2594D3	5	negative	 This homework took longer than usual I feel like I am finally getting more comfortable with map reduce I thought many of the questions could have been worded more clearly and that the assumptions should have been made clearer Problem one took me a few hours and problem two took me a couple hours 
25E590	2	negative	 For the homework i have confused about that data nodes I don t know whether i understand it correctly if i send a command to the namenode to download a data the namenode will locate the data in one data node but it wil not check the data is vaild or not So i have the chance to download the incorrect or invaild data And if i download a data many times for each time i don t necessarily download it from one data node because a data usually has many duplications and the namenode will locate the data in different data node for different times I confuse about this conception about the namenode and data node 
2662FB	1	positive	 This homework is designed reasonably well as a good starting point exercise The first problem is a basic test on students understanding of big data concepts through looking into various types of data points The only imperfection is that the section d is a bit ambiguous in terms of asking the difference and implication The second problem is a nice practice of probability skills And it also extends what students read from textbook with more insight of the similar problem The third one is to test students reading and summary skills which is good for encouraging students to read more on their own but might be not so effective in terms of enhancing students hand on skills The bonus problem is a great practice of taking advantage of review for the course to produce resources for coursework In a nutshell this homework is well organized 
2731CC	4	negative	 This homework was harder compared to previous homeworks It did take more time too For me debugging it and figuring out what I was doing wrong took a while for me It should have taken less time if I didn t make a mistake Overall even though this homework took a while it was a do able homework 
28FE75	5	positive	 This homework was a late submission because of midterms I was able to complete all of it since it was pretty straightforward I did get confused with computing the communication cost and am still not sure that I did it correctly The word co occurrence one was fun and seems like we re headed towards more fun implementation stuff Had to do a lot of local testing on eclipse this is becoming a habit now  
29C459	5	positive	 This homework seemed like it was just a repition of things we have done in previous labs The only new thing that it introduced for me that I enjoyed was the co occurrence problems It helped put into perspective all the things to consider when creating a program like this including any issues that might arrise in a pairs approach Overall this homework was good in providing reinforcement of previous labs and an introduction to something new 
2B20B3	2	positive	 I like the question  of this homework because they make me know how to use Map reduce the data size more clearly I like to combine the knowledge and code or I would use code or program to implement the theory And question one makes me fully understand the theory of how to use data node and name node as well as the relationship of them 
2B8DC2	2	positive	 I think homework is kind of helping me understand the basic concept of hdfs After finishing the first question I do feel I understand hdfs better but some hint is not pointing to the right place Question and question help me familar with mapreduce process which is very important process of the hdfs And I m getting the idea of how this is coming to work 
2C2014	7	negative	 This lab was very interesting in that we got familiar with the computation for similarities between items and coming up with collaborative filtering which was quite vague from the start and lectures but ended up as a very useful tool after I thoroughly understand the concept and implement during hte homework I was quite surprised with the fact that different algorithms associated with MapReduce process could be used for collaborative filtering Implementation of the code for index inverting was a bit hard but after we finished implementation it was easy to comprehend the concept and had some confidence in implementing this kind of new concepts in programming I was impressed by this homework and was really thankful for the chance to understand the concepts we learned through the lectures The problems in homework were deeply related to the concepts we have in the slides and the contents in the slides were very useful to solving this assignment Thank you
2C6982	7	positive	 This homework was not as difficult nor time consuming compared to the past few homeworks THe cosine similarity calculation was confusing at first but once I understood the formula and how each map reduce steps work it was easy to get to the answer The other conceptual problems took a little bit of thinking but was not bad The code implemntation part for problem one did not take that long so it was not bad 
2D958F	8	positive	 This homework is not difficult I like Spark more than MapReduce It s more similar to Matlab or Julia REPL It s really nice for exploring and experimenting how to transform data efficiently So I think one can use Spark to get a working pipeline and implement that in MapReduce when large scale computation is needed Not too many implementation trick to discover as programming MapReduce with Java I m happy with that  This homework is not difficult I like Spark more than MapReduce It s more similar to Matlab or Julia REPL It s really nice for exploring and experimenting how to transform data efficiently So I think one can use Spark to get a working pipeline and implement that in MapReduce when large scale computation is needed Not too many implementation trick to discover as programming MapReduce with Java I m happy with that 
2E4EA5	9	neutral	 Homework contains plenty problems Though it dues longer than others I must first review the materials for the exam When I start looking at it I have to look up to the slides two weeks ago to get everything clear It took me almost a whole day to finish it But it is a great help for understanding the usage of pig and the algorithm of Pagerank 
2E78CD	2	positive	 I enjoyed this homework because it helped me further understand how storage works in HDFS Asking about specfic commands and the way files are stored is good practice In addition figuring out how MapReduce works step by step was my favorite part of the homework While some of this work was pretty simple I am hopefull that future homeworks will let me solve complex problems with what was taught in this homework I think homework provided an excellent base for storage and MapReduce in HDFS 
3018E6	7	negative	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to use the use of combiner and partitioner in mapreduce jobs which can orgnise the result of mapper to save memory or call several reducers And I also got more familiar to the design and implement of the combiner and partitioner and their working theory 
31A0D6	3	positive	 This homework was a lot easier than the last two ones I think I learned a lot from the first problem because I feel like I got my feet wet with a real map reduce program in the virtual machine environment The second problem was vague because you didn t specify the assumptions about how long it takes to reduce a word count The third problem was mostly looking at the slides 
31EBF9	7	positive	 I did not think that this homework assignment was too difficult For one we did have two weeks to do it and the only programming portion was a short and easy implementation of the MapReduce job for the invert indices task The second quesiton was purely conceptual and not too difficult either just from reading lecture slides and the book The third question was probably the most difficult with running the similarity task via pen and paper but I believe it was still manageable 
320BE1	3	positive	 For this assignment we were able to experience the map reduce program first hand which was very useful because we actually observed the output file and how the whole process works I now have a much better understanding of map reduce programs and the strength it possesses and I am excited to see further implementations of this powerful method 
32E8EC	3	positive	 This time I spend some time on concatenating the previous contents into together I prefer to use a global view to treat the problems and understand I still have some conceptual terminology needs to be understand And some parts used the lab commands practices I think I need more time to understanding each process of it 
33634C	6	positive	 This homework help us to understand what is the combiner In the class we have the basic idea about what is the combiner I only know that this is a mini reducer but don t know how to use it After this homework by using the combiner and compare the result of the mapreduce with combiner and without combiner really help us to understand the work of the combiner 
34DC1D	2	positive	 Homework assignment number was not too difficult Most of the conceptual questions had answers that were capable of being found in the hdfs book The most interesting questions revolved around design For example question you had to think of how space is managed on the rack and cluster to meet requirements of replication and fault tolerance I also enjoyed the MapReduce questions since they involved a more hands on approach to processing the flow of the data and what happens to it at different stages of the MapReduce pipeline 
351AE1	4	positive	 I wish we went over more about Distributed cache in class In particular since hadoop documentation isn t the most specific I had trouble getting the tool runner parameter for using the local files as distributed files and some clarity would have been nice Additionally it doesn t make a ton of sense to have us implement testing since most people don t know how to write junit tests Overall I think i had more trouble getting the little bits of the homework running more so than understanding it conceptually 
35C4C7	8	positive	 This homework was probably one of the shortest homeworks we had in this class After looking up some commands about Spark I was able to finish it fairly quickly Also the slides basically had most of the answers to it or all the commands we needed to know to complete this homework Thus it was fairly easy It did not take a lot of time like the other homeworks so I enjoyed this homework 
35D7EE	1	positive	 I thought that the first problem was straightforward and enjoyed doing it I could not find the specific table you used in class on any of the slides though I had trouble with problem because I got the right answer for p and d I also enjoyed the reading for problem 
35DAC5	9	negative	 Very very disappointed by Problem and Those two problems themselves are fine But my Pig won t run due to some strange bug I m pretty sure my scripts are correct Very very disappointed by Problem and Those two problems themselves are fine But my Pig won t run due to some strange bug I m pretty sure my scripts are correct   
389C8F	9	negative	 I found thiw homework to be frustrating I ended up getting stuck a lot and sometimes it was for obvious things Other times I d get stuck on syntax or not so obvious things I ended up running out of time despite the extra time allotted for this homework I probably spent more time on this homework than any other assignment Overall I found it to be very frustrating 
38B21C	6	positive	 I like this homework You can really build up the whole project step by step in the first homework problem Building up the whole framework first then starting to fill up or perfect individual parts is an important strategy Also testing string file parsing code in a separate file first is very helpful So you don t get all the complications from the whole hadoop system It was a bit frustrating when implementing the distributed cache I didn t realize you don t need to add special stuff to the driver when using ToolRunner to implement distributed cache It is actually simple 
3933FA	8	negative	 this homework is not that difficult but i still confused with the problem part c when i use map function to extract activation from xml it will return a list rdd result each item in the list is another list so i can t use getmodel and getaccount function in my map function because it can t work on the list So i have to use flatMap to extract activation this will generate a list rdd and each item is a activation type index So is there any way just using map function instead of flatMap then convert item in each list to activation item 
39BA20	3	negative	 For homework almost every question has been dealt with on the course But i just have confused about the question b it says that we can find the answer through lab and cheet sheet But i think that the question need us check the total lines from files in the hadoop directly But for lab there is no access about how to check file in hadoop so is that means wo should download the file from hadoop to local client first then check the lines of it 
3B17A3	4	negative	 For this homework i spend lots of time to read the slides I still confused about when i run the job locally i need to put in the path of the files to my java code otherwise i can t find the txt file even it in my job running folder And i still don t know how to run the jar file locally using command line when i obtain the lab it always return to me that the roote is illegal In details the fs can t be distinguished by the command line I also want to know how to change the name of the reducer in my java file Is this possible 
3D3DEF	4	negative	 This particular homework left me feeling pretty frustrated I have been trying to fight back from being behind in some of my classes and this one is no exception I was attempting to finish late last night but fell asleep and only had a little bit of time to try to finish it up today I am enjoyed the subject matter of this homework but I ran into too many problems to end on a good note SVN was giving me issues so I had to meet with somebody in Engineering services to figure out my problem another unneeded delay   
3E7393	9	negative	 This homework is extremely challenging and complex It encompasses pagerank theory matrix vector multiplication implementation in Spark Spark job excution details and Pig usage Using scala for the Spark program added more complexity than using python Students are examined across a number of data processing techniques so doing this homework is also incredibly rewarding But more instructions on how to write code in scala or pig were expected before digging into this homework 
3E8B9A	4	negative	 This homework is really a difficult one when I am trying to code the configuration I spend a lot of time finding the best way to implement the setup function into mappers And when I am coding partitioner I spend a lot of time accessing txt files and I still have trouble executing the partitioner job using command line after that So it is a really hard homework for us to finish I spend three days to doing so 
3F787A	9	positive	 It took me about hour to finish this week s homework The problems themselves are not very difficult The concept and framework seem easy to understand However I got stuck on coding details I have not learned languages similar to Pig Latin before Might still need few weeks to get used to it 
3FD84E	3	positive	 I am familiar with linux commands to process lists and count values Adding the hadoop calls to pull the necessary inputs from the HDFS filesystem are also fairly straightforward Improving the MapReduce WordCount algorithm could be done in several ways I m sure as the course goes on these improvements will become more obvious The concepts of skew and the components of a Hadoop cluster are becoming more familiar Each daemon has a specific role and those components must work together 
42432B	9	negative	 This time I worked with a partner as the homework was substantially longer than normal It helps that we were given an extra week but with the midterm and keeping up with other exams each problem definitely took longer than normal That s normal I guess since there are more parts In particular I would say that problem was rather tedious and I saw no real value from doing the steps and stages but I could follow matrix math pretty easily In all this was a longer less interesting hw compared to the other assignments we v done 
4304AA	8	positive	 I think python is useful for big data analysis I will put more time on that and use the language to earn spark And professor also mention that spark is much more important for the data analysis The second question is not easy to think I just spend lots of time on that      
435456	7	positive	 This homework comprehensively inspects the understanding of input format of MapReduce program and collaborative filtering used in the recommendation system It is well designed to guide the students to implement a specific MapReduce program using a non default input format class And the final problem allows students to walk through the two jobs in the similarity approach which gives them a direct and effective practice 
439FE9	9	positive	 This assignment was more challenging than others but it was also one of the most informative ones so far The homework had multiple components to it the biggest two being Spark and PIG and it helped me and my partner get a deep understanding of each subject s properties and how we can benefit from using it 
44BE2F	8	negative	 The homeworks are more interesting than the labs The labs possibly due to poor explanation and vague questioning are not as interesting However the homeworks are becoming more and more useful I am encouraged by the continued advancement of the course materials and look forward to continuing to learn I am more excited by the prospect of actually getting to write my own code and move out of the low level examples
45341A	2	positive	 I was a little more confident in homework The HDFS filesystem is abstract since blocks are distributed across many data nodes but the concept is fairly straightforward I am already familiar with the unix linux equivalent commands that are used in the hadoop fs command interface I am also starting to get the hang of the way a Mapper and Reducer work as well as the map and reduce functions Basic simple operations but the organization of those operations is important 
4651AC	1	negative	 The homework was more theoritical than I thought it will be Problem was especially lot more theoritical I was expecting it to be more of introductory questions Overall I was bit disappointed with the homework this time Hopefully it will get better going forward There was very less to do with the textbooks content in this homework which was unexpected to me 
46EB38	9	negative	 I thought this homework was particularly long especially considering we didn t really get any extra time to work on it since the remaining time was spent studying for the exam We ran into some trouble with writing down pseudo code for the SPARK matrix vector multiplication program and we also found probably to be particularly difficult to implement I did like that problem one focused on the book problems as I thought that those problems were a good extension of the material that we had learnt in class 
48EC50	1	neutral	 Starting the first homework for a new course can always be a bit stressful as you don t always know what to expect or how much time it will take Judging from the feedback on this homework one can better judge how to perform the homeworks for the rest of the semester Question gave me the most frustration as it took me much longer to figure out than I thought it would Once I got it though my confidence in my statistical abilities was restored I get confused sometimes when asked to answer questions on an article as I m not always sure I m answering the same material the question is asking 
495C73	3	negative	 Homework three is not so hard I just need to read the textbook to get the knowledge of the HDFS But I m a little disappointed since homework three is still just requires writing I m looking forward to more practical problems like programming a real mapper or  reducer Fortunately it will come next time 
4971E1	1	neutral	 I found the homework assignment interesting but slightly frustrating I enjoyed having the combination of reading assignment problems combined with the math problem However I was slightly confused in that I was unsure of how long each answer should be for the literary analysis problems I was unclear on the level of detail I should provide Lastly I was odd but not bad that we weren t really familiar with the topics involved in the math problem Overall I thought the level of difficulty for the problems was decent and I enjoyed the opportunity to obtain extra credit 
4B6412	6	negative	 The homeworks are more interesting than the labs The labs possibly due to poor explanation and vague questioning are not as interesting However the homeworks are becoming more and more useful I am encouraged by the continued advancement of the course materials and look forward to continuing to learn I am more excited by the prospect of actually getting to write my own code and move out of the low level examples
4BF4B2	9	positive	 This homework was a little longer compared to other homework The first two problems were good review questions for the exam The last three problems give us opportunity to practice PIG The questions asked very detailed concepts about Spark so we had to go over the sides to find the answers I liked the questions about PIG because we could actually process data and saw the results 
4BFD49	8	positive	 This homework help us to understand how to use the spark to compute with the big data We have already did a practice in the last lab however without the step by step guide this homework did really slow especially the problem We have to read the spark api and programming guide which you gave us in lab to find the function and the command But after finished the homework we really can do something with spark much more familier with the command line and understand what is the pipeline of rdd and how to use it But at very first time I don t know I should do all the things within rdd I just take the value to a variable and deal like a normal python file I hope you can give us a tip for that 
4DEFA7	4	negative	 I thought this homework was kind of hard However I think I learned a lot from it I wonder if this is what Professor Neumann uses to analyze our homework review files Overall this homework was challenging especially question d which really required us to think creatively  Looking forward to the next one 
4DFABE	1	neutral	 Overall it wasn t too bad My main gripes lie with Problem I see the benefit of getting comfortable the six dimensions of big data and learning how they apply to different data sets but debating whether or not data sets meet loosely defined criteria seems like a needlessly semantic exercise It s also pretty amibiguous in places and dealing with this ambiguity accounted for a good amount of the time I spent working on this assignment It was one of those assignments where I was never sure if I was answering the question that the instructions wanted me to answer making it pretty uncomfortable to work on Problem was the best by virtue of being the most concrete Felt like a solid way of internalizing Bonferonni s principle Problem was okay although I felt like I was really grasping at straws to figure out what more there is to say about labeled vs unlabeled data and I guess I won t know until I get the assignment back whether I said enough Hoping future assignments are a little more concrete and a little more direct about what they expect 
4E671E	8	positive	 This homework was a great chance for me to conceptualize Spark and become more dexterous with utilizing it Some of the problems were intriguing in that the syntaxes were unfamiliar and hard to grasp at first how to deal with those problems regarding with Spark Also most of the process stored in Spark and hdfs system were not tangible and not easily visualized by being saved in some storages so it was hard to debug and keep track of what I was doing But after we finalized this homework we recognized it was not as hard as expected and we got satisfactory results with all the implementations then we got some confidence in implementing Spark programming I really liked the way everything was organized in homework and structure of the homework was so rigid and legitimate in that I could get some insights on Spark after then Thank you and I really appreciated doing this homework 
4EF4F2	9	neutral	 This homework is really long compared to the last one but point wise it s the same Some students expressed frustration over this fact I m ok with it since everyone is hold to the same standard If I don t get A it s fine Problem is hard for me because I m not well versed in matrix math Hopefully this homework wont be too bad 
52E895	7	neutral	 Problem was pretty alright no major complaints there Only thing worth mentioning is that I was totally unable to find Table  in HTDG I m not sure if there s some appendix that I haven t found but I couldn t find any tables in Chapter beyond Table  Example  was pretty helpful though that would be a better reference Problem was fine Problem was a real pain It s easy to imagine someone with a solid understanding of the material might lose points on copying errors I checked my word like times and I m still not sure that I didn t make any typos are hard to catch All in all not too bad it ll really come down to how it s graded 
539C2D	7	positive	 this homework is quite funny At first I tried to write a custom FileInput then someone point out that there is a built in InputFormat that I can use I kept throwing myself at it That makes it the second time I tried to write a customized class in Hadoop I m used to do this at my job so it s not really a big problem Some other students might struggle with it though 
56C496	1	negative	 I feel the first question i e Problem is little annoying Especially for the second problem i e the wikipedia article one The question seems not very clear Specifically I m not sure what the object is whether it s wikipedia articals as a whole or a specific article So I tried to answer in both ways and hopefully this can give me a good mark  Also the compounds question seems require some chemical knowledge and the knowledge is not shallow As I m not good at chemics it causes some trouble for me  For Problem again it s not very clear especially for the definition of same In the problem same is said several times however for sentences like they will meet in the same hotel I m not sure about whether they must meet in the same hotel for all d days or they just need to get together whatever the hotel Still I tried both as there are justification below which is really good I then understand the meaning  For Problem I really don t like the artical as well as the question The artical talks all about translation and it uses several terminologies Unfortunately I have no knowledge about them at all Also it seems that in order to read this artical you need some basic understanding about machine learning which I think is not a very good requirement especially after the first week of the course   
57E44C	4	positive	 In general I really enjoy doing homework Both questions contain implementation part which I really like It helps me to do actually hadoop map reduce examples Both examples are very useful The sentiment analysis question is really interesting It give me one way to analyze sentiment in a text Also they help me to understand ToolRunner better 
584707	4	positive	 This homework assignment was not too difficult for the most part I got through problem fairly easy though I was confused on parts b and parts c where the prompt asked for differences in command execution between local toolrunner and hdfs programs Similarly I also found problem to be not too difficult as well However I do think it would be helpful to have optional reading available on how to improve sentiment analysis just to see what the instructor would recommend 
5B9B9D	5	negative	 In general I really don t like homework The implementation parts are interesting However the theoretical questions are very boring particularly question part d I would prefer to have more implementation exercises rather than keep looking at the slides to answer the theoretical questions It take a lot of times and very boring 
5BA47D	8	negative	 This homework took me two day to finish I used python for spark Although I have learned python before It still took me some time to learn how to write pyspark code All of the outputs will be shown in the command window is sometimes annoying It becomes a little bit hard to review the codes written before 
5C5A12	7	negative	 To tell the truth I don t like this one However I know it is very important to go over the procedure and run the MR by hand paper and pencil I just seem that s lame  The first implementation question rasies some interesting questings As always all those questions are repeating asking one question What s the Mapper s Key value of a Raw text input The answer is Type Longwritable Key offset I always try to ignore those facts But after this time nope 
5C74D6	9	negative	 This is a long homework Though we have two weeks to do the homework still think it s too long The last question is pretty boring basically the same as question Just don t understand why we need it here Really don t like the virtual machine lose connet to localhost all the time Just cannot understand why Hope this is the last homework Don t want to do any homework after the exam 
5D01F9	4	neutral	 good job This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got a better understanding about how the map reduce algorithm works in java and I wrote the program of it on my own which is very helpful for me to learn the program better 
5F30C8	1	neutral	 This homework is a good measurement on how much work is expected on future homework It is quite intensive given that Problem and are open ended I find problem a little hard to understand I got the formula but the result from my formula and also is my partner s are not consistent with the result table you gave us 
60227E	7	negative	 In this homework we were able to implement the inverted index mapper and reducer Overall the implementation was straightforward We were able to successfully complete the code The only difficulty was to figure out the input format as there were not enough examples in the slides Also creating test input was tricky It turned out that our program did not run because the format of the test was not correct It would save us a lot of time if we knew that earlier 
6086C9	5	positive	 This homework was intense just because I was working right up until the last minute I got help from TAs and dodged a sticky svn situation but managed to get it all done I think I am encouraged because I think I m slowly getting the hang of implementing new mapreduce solutions I am realizing more and more how useful ToolRunner is Overall it was a positive experience 
61FC35	2	negative	 My description for Homework starts with the Getting Started Indicating Group Work and Submission Instructions sections Because they have appeared on both homeworks so far and I anticipate they will be included on every homework assignment these sections evoke an air of disinterest On this particular homework I think most of the questions were positive in nature with the exception of one There was a question within the first problem asking the student to sketch out a diagram As I have been writing my homework solutions in Latex this particular question caused me some feeling of frustration because I was forced to draw a picture on some separate medium or program whether it was just pen and paper or another computer application and then figure out how to convert it to a pdf and submit it with the rest of my homework 
624F60	3	positive	 I really enjoyed this homework I thought it had a very good mix of coding problems conceptual problems research and text book readings I liked that we used the executable file that we created in class and that we ran analysis on the output of the execution My only complaint is that it was difficult to find information on the YARN scheduler process as we hadn t really covered it in detail n class beyond saying it was a resource manager job scheduler 
62AD83	7	positive	 This homework help us to understand how to compute the item item similarity using hadoop mapreduce and how this method compute the similarities and what is the merit of using normalization and different similarity mesures We can not find the answer simply through the text book and the lecture powerpoint so we have to search a lot from internet This help us to understand more besides the knowledge from lecture and lab The last problem help us to clear the mapreduce operation we can understand what this program doing clearly 
62DD21	4	positive	 First time coding homework This homework is really helpful for us to understand how to code the job program how to use the tool runner to read the files and run locally by using different method Due to the first time programming homework it is a little bit difficult and challenge for us but thanks to the clearly lecture pdf we can find the method quickly The only one thing is the Unit test part but after we asked the professor it seems we can not run the test on haddoop with the file on cache it confused us long time but solved finally 
6400C0	9	negative	 This homework was quite long I did part of problem and before the midterm but got sick during the weekend so couldn t devote much time to study and got a C on the midterm sad but i m the only one to blame The Pig assignment was interesting since I did not have experience with SQL I really really really enjoy working with spark and think it s a useful tool to have in my arsenal all in all pretty good need to do hwM so that I can replace my shitty hw grade with that one 
64DC04	2	negative	 The Problem and are very important and reveals the procedure of a typical MapReduce Gernally I like them  However the Problem is such a boring work The hadoop operation review is OK but when you tried to finish the sketch and diagram it takes you forever to get a decent representation  Indeed the Problem ruins my night due to its boredom 
665520	9	negative	 I wasn t a huge fan of this assignment The PageRank problems were tricky because the way the book does it is different from the Spark program we were given I feel like there wasn t enough instruction given to understand what needed to be changed about the Spark program A lot of people needed to go to office hours where TAs just told people exactly what to change As for the pig stuff it wasn t that bad although some of the questions could have been worded better 
6814C3	3	neutral	 My review for Homework is neutral for the most part The questions were fairly straightforward which translated to a period of work that was mostly satisfying and rewarding My only negative sentiments came from problem because I struggled to come to an understanding of the questions regarding skew A slight feeling of frustration also followed the assignment because it took longer than I wanted it too 
68D73D	1	neutral	 Some parts of this homework were quite confusing but once I took the problem step by step it was doable Problem one was fairly easy to determine and justify Problem two was very challenging at first but it all made sense at the end Problem three was also slightly challenging and took some time to complete since the answers to the questions were not obvious from the reading I had to carefully read the article to understand and answer the questions Overall after finishing the homework it was not too bad 
691A2F	2	positive	 This homework really help me a lot In the lecture I only have a theoretical understanding and I have some confusion with how do they work with the mapper function and mapper reducer The homework make me much clearer with the concept and when I talk with my partner I will get different ideas and different understanding ways from each other 
699954	2	neutral	 This homework thoroughly examines the understanding of the distributed file system in hadoop However it does not well reflect what is been taught in class More practical problems can be added in the homework MapReduce problems are good exercises to examine the understanding of the data flow in MapReduce framework All in all this homework is a satisfactory one 
69F25F	3	positive	 Homework still require quire a lot of reading but it is helpful for understanding the overall excution of a job in the mapreduce in terms of yarn Q makes me further look at the content of lab on how the hadoop excuting the jobs I think next homework will need to write some code according to what we have done this time 
6BE565	7	positive	 I thought this was a practical way of learning and reviewing what we did for the lab quiz However I do think that that doing this as our lab quiz would have been much more helpful than doing the lab quiz first Furthermore computing the components of cosine similarity are not explained in detail in the lecture slides Such as computing dot product and normalization 
6D77EC	3	positive	 This homework is a good one Firstly we use java to apply MapReduce jobs in HDFS and analyse the whole process and result file in our homework Then we use the YARN RM to detect the process of job execution Finally by the provided reading we learn something about the skew of MapRedece jobs So it is a good homework for us to complete 
6DD32E	5	positive	 Homework is relatively an easy one I managed to finish it fluently and quickly In fact it is even easier than homework Pretty happy about it I used to hink there should be something about secondary sort which will be complicated Luckily that is not the case So happy about it I hope homework is similar since fall break is approaching and so are the midterms 
6DD38F	5	negative	 This homework was especially problematic It was very unclear for example problem c what it meant by being problematic Is it problematic when running the MapReduce or the Combiner or I emailed the teaching assistant and it seemed that he was hinting along the lines of it being problematic in constructing information about the whole sentence 
6E59DF	7	positive	 At the beginning when I saw the Hw q I have not idea what to do and also I can t find any materials in the course power point It is not tough and I m happyI finish the last mapreduce homework In conclusion I think I still need to learn more about the whole framework for the mapreduce job and also look forward to using spark to complete mapreduce job 
6F671F	2	positive	 This homework help us to review the lectures from last week and also lab The thing like programming the command is easy to remember and understand if we use them I like the homework include the basic command of hadoop which we learned in lab I can use it smooth next time And the last two question help us review the idea of mapreduce function Maybe it is better to give us a example how this work in a program Still the biggest problem is in the reading There are some question I can not find from book or lecture maybe there is the answer but I didn t find it so I have to work through the internet and it cost a lot of time but still uncertainty 
702F81	7	neutral	 This homework is ok I got stuck in implementing the reverse indexer I had trouble with the input format I search every corner I could to learn how to set the separator for reading in a line directly as key and value But I failed to find detailed information There are examples online but they didn t work for me The rest is not difficult Proving normalized cosine distance equals to pearson correlation is a trivial task it s not worth proving 
72855F	5	neutral	 I found this homework to be quite challenging Getting started was particularly difficult Once I understood how everything was set up I felt a little better about it but still struggled with some of the implementation I thought question was slightly easier than question one but I was a little confused with some of the more conceptual questions 
72CB83	6	neutral	 This homework was both frustrating and rewarding I got stuck for a long time trying to figure out why the job on the pseudo cluster was failing to get data from the movie titles file It was working when I tested locally because the file was accessible in my local directory The problem was that I was forgetting to add the file to my Distributed Cache After I figured out this trivial error it was smooth sailing Once I have everything going smoothly I really like running mapreduce jobs and working with big data It is very satisfying to watch a job run and see massive amounts of data be parsed and manipulated according to our jobs 
7312C3	9	negative	 I thought this homework assignment was extremely challenging and believe that the unclear instructions made it much more difficult to complete Problems and could have been more explicit on what the SPARK program was to do Even though problem was very lax in how to implement the solution it would have been better to have a more explicit guideline on how to solve it Problem was confusing in the wording of the instructions Should we count each file individually or the total count of the entire directory 
731B11	6	negative	 This homework was particularly hard I ran into several issues along the way but it was particularly difficult to send the output from the first stage to the second state I felt less prepared for this homework than I have for the previousones so it may be a sign that I need to prepare more and leave more time for the homeworks in the future 
757FAC	1	positive	 I think this homework is highly relative with the course documents and the class lectures so I really need to listen every word during the lecture It is very encouraged for me to force on the lecture And just one thing I need to practice is that the editing skills in Word For problem we can write tidy on the paper but transferring the formula from paper to electrical document spends some time but it is worth 
76BF3B	4	negative	 It causes troubles for distributed cache implementation which is really annoying  Also I don t think we have enough materials for distributed cache on slides and it s really frustrating  Worsely the link on the slides has certain formats and can t be copied directly  Hope we could have a more flexible schedule and deadline for the course 
775E30	9	negative	 For this homework we have major problems and minor questions  The topics range from PageRank Spark to Pig    Is that too many for one homework    If this homework only worth pts in total man I will definitely abandon set of questions  To be honest our graders usually deduct credit from an unperfect answer for  pts  Attention this credit deducted is not proportionally to the total credit for a minor question  Which means if you lose pts from a pt question Congrats bro    And for this homework you will find pts for minor questions which means each one get pts in average  Again for an unperfect answer you will lose a great propotion of creadits due to many unperfect answers    Thus I highly recommend our instructor to split this homework to two individual ones and reassign the credits   I think this homework is a tough one We had to learn a lot and refer to a lot of things rather than focus on only one or two aspects   
78793D	3	positive	 Overall the homework is not difficult But it requires quite a bit searching and reading Problem made me to familiarize myself with hadoop linux commands It was a bit frustrating to just find out how those command combinations work I wish there were some hints e g which key word to use to extract the information Also I was not familiar with the syntax How to get linux commands to work on HDFS file was a problem for me Until later I realized what cat does is to copy data from HDFS to the local memory So one can perform linux commands on the local copy Problem is good for understanding skew I just don t like the terms in the first question of problem I don t think anyone would consider those when running a real hadoop job 
78F68D	8	neutral	 This homework was okay We got stuck on question two for a little but we managed to figure it out It was a little hard because of the initial work we had to do with Spark but we managed to figure it out We ran into problems with the stub script that was given to us but we figured it out 
7A4B0C	3	neutral	 This assignment was somewhat less interesting than homework The reason is because I felt this assignment was more theoretical than application The main reason I liked questions a and b is because in order to answer those questions youhad to complete something in the virtual machine All the other questions were mainly questons that answered What if 
7C07FC	6	negative	 I thought this homework was somewhat challenging The instructions for the lab could have been written a lot more clearly The example code that was given from the github repository just made me more confused because there were so many things that we didn t cover and I didn t know I was supposed to ignore or delete 
7D2924	7	positive	 This homework had a good balance of implementation and theory It was also very closely related to the stuff we ve talked about in class  I think the similarity measrure stuff from class was important and I m glad this homework covered all of that and some Not entirely sure that i did it correctly Also I got stuck with the inverted index using KeyValueTextInputFormat class I used an all text signature which solved it Let s see how it goes 
7D9E54	3	negative	 There is absolutely low coding load in this homework So it  should have been an easy assignment and finished in Probably  one or two hours which turned out to be wrong I spent several  hours going through text book and lecture slides and building  a detailed and accurate understanding on processes and terms  mentioned in three problems But all in all that is a good  thing since I will never know if I truly make it clear what  we learn in class 
7E26B4	3	negative	 In fact I don t really enjoy doing homework The first assignment is fun but I think it would be more interesting if we can do further than the word count mapreduce The second and third questions are just reading and copying from slides and textbook which I don t really like 
7E6876	1	positive	 Homework assignment number one was for the most part easy Question one ended up being highly open ended which was good because it allowed for several interpretations as correct answers but I found it a bad experience in that I was unsure of what the expected answer was and how pedantic grading might be regarding which justifications are detailed enough Question two only required minor modification to the problem discussed in mmds so was not difficult Question three was also easy to accomplish after a quick read through of the article given 
7EDB93	9	negative	 A really long homework actually it covered many important topics including spark pig  BUt from it I can see some convinience by usinng spark and pig which will get difficult and  complex in MapReduce But as one single homework it s overloaded and thus I spent much time  on it plus there are many latent readings 
8117C1	5	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to use the use of combiner and partitioner in mapreduce jobs which can orgnise the result of mapper to save memory or call several reducers And I also got more familiar to the design and implement of the combiner and partitioner and their working theory 
81828C	1	positive	 I think this homework help me with some basic concepts of big data especially the properties of big data Problem two is a mathematics problem The article is pretty long to read and it s not that easy to understand the idea of what the author try to say After carefully reading it for several time I finally understand the data based approach which is a pretty important point in the article Personally it s quite helpful but I think I would understand the article better ifI already have some background in big data 
82D10C	6	positive	 last week i have two mid term exams so i use the late due for the hw it s really cost some time For this homework i compare with my code to the github i find that it use the method logger but i don t find where i should use it so i don t use that way to generte my code what s the different with or without the method logger why the github use it but that doesn t matter all the output should by integar but the input txt let them all double so i change all my output key to be double 
83E2C5	6	positive	 This homework is not hard as its the same thing as the lab which gives step by step instructions and a code example There was no class last Thursday so we have more time for it As a results we have more times to prepare other midterms which is really really good Though I don t have any midterm at all By the way the question this time seems much easier than previous ones I think for most of them we can find the answer directly from the slides which is pretty good Oeverall I like this style 
8474C1	6	positive	 For this lab I had some trouble with the data structures and later took a long time debugging it It was helpful to re read the slides a couple of times and keep track one by one how our data is allocated Turns out I was reading the movie id as a string causing me to get either the wrong movie name or null This lab was fun because I actually had a chance to use my pen and paper lol 
848507	5	positive	 This homework contains two problems which both examine the implementation of MapReduce program The first one guides students in a way of debugging and testing the code gradually via local job and pseudo cluster This is a wisely designed practice However its content is a little similar to previous lab and homework which might make itself a bit duplicate The second one let students better understand the communication cost which is pretty useful 
850A3E	4	negative	 I didn t really like this assignment There were a lot of little things that I was having issues with and I wasn t able to make it to many of the TA hours When I did go to TA hours the TA had apparently cancelled so I was left to struggle It was also a pain to test this assignment because my computer doesn t have a ton of RAM The only way to consistently be able to run a MapReduce job without freezing up the VM was to close eclipse first which was then very slow to start back up 
878D70	9	negative	 In general the homework is durable It helps me to understand spark and pig very well particularly question  However the problem is that this homework is too long It s almost double the amount of work that I spent on each other homework We should split it into homework 
897BE4	5	positive	 This homework help us to review the mapreduce program The first problem is quite like the wordcount program which we write the code before By writting again this kind of program we can understand how this mapper and reducer work deeply And the question also help us to review the locations of output and input file of mapreduce program when running in hadoop which I don t understand well before so I read the slides of lecture and reed the textbook to find the answer 
8ACE99	8	negative	 I thought this assignment could use more instructions for Problem For example loading and using the functions defined in the pyspark file and then using them in the actual assignment for transformation could have used a lot more clarification and took significantly longer to complete than the other parts 
8B2FAB	6	positive	 I really like this homework The first part is really just the lab The second part takes a little bit longer due to the statistic needs to be collected I think overall I m happy with what the homework can offer I hope the final project will be as challenging if not more than this one There are times I dont have a clue The development strategy really helped me 
8C97CB	1	positive	 I thought this homework was pretty interesting I enjoyed how the questions were very diverse ranging from conceptual questions to math questions and finally to reading analysis I thought the first part was in a way the most challenging as I found that certain data could be characterized in different ways For examples I was not sure what would constitute a large amount of data versus a small amount of data and what size of data would be considered large or small Either way I justified my answers to the best of my abilities Overall I thought the homework was nice in that it covered many different topics 
8C9D24	6	negative	 This homework was also a late submission because of midterms I was not able to complete all of it since it needed two jobs We ran into a lot of type issues with LongWritables and Text which was a pain to troubleshoot In the end I think our code is correct but still having issues with uploading files to Distributed cache and analyzing from there SOS 
8CB259	4	positive	 This homework was very exciting First time really digging into mapreduce Great that we re getting into coding I wish there was a little more direction particularly on the partitioner implementation I enjoyed the challenge of needing to re learn java and thing more ciritically about program design I look forward to future homeworks now 
8DEBD0	1	neutral	 This homework was straightforward and a good introduction to the course A few of the questions were left to interpretation which is unusual for a CS class I enjoyed having to read the article as I think this provides us with different perceptions about how data should be processed organized and analyzed This is key especially in a rapidly growing field where the tools change frequently Understanding the different approaches can only help improve our understanding and enhance our problem solving abilities 
8E75CC	3	positive	 This homework was actually pretty helpful I felt like there was still a degree of textbook regurgitation but the directions were a little more specific and there wasn t any of the petty semantic arguments present in the first homework Overall I think it helped solidify my understanding of MR Job Execution 
8EB444	5	negative	 for this homework i have confused about the co occurence word i only have the way to sepearte the word using block space to keep all the non word character in the word the i delete all that part for each word but if i do like that the form of the word has been changed for a word anti social if i use the way i mentioned before it should like antisocial without the how can i pick up all co occurence words correctly and still keep them the same as before 
8F164E	1	positive	 The difficulty of this homework is modest Among it problem cost most of time since I need tomake some calculations and validate the result Also I have to spend time reading through the paper of problem In conclusion this homework is not hard at all but it takes you time to finish 
8F4174	8	positive	 Even though I thought this assignment was going to be hard it was actually better than I expected Because I was not familiar with the Spark language I wasbit hesitant However after reading through the slides and going to TA hours the TA was able to clear up any confusion I had and so I understood the concepts alot more clearly 
8F7566	5	positive	 In this homework we also did a few programming exercises The structures of the functions are similar to the previous homework so it is not that hard this time We also look at the YARN resource manager so that we can understand better the statistics of the jobs The open ended questions are harder to do this time because a lot of concepts are involved and we need to go back to the slides to look for the answer Overall the homework is managable and we are able to finish it in a reasonable time 
90240E	1	negative	 This homework was really helpful for me to review and fully understand the contents we have learned from lecture Analysis of Big Data properties helped me to get familiar with various properties of Big Data such as infinity structure and complexity that I was confused during the lecture Analysis on my own gave me more intuition on understanding confusing concepts regarding Big Data Mathematical problem was quite time consuming but I personally think this problem is really interesting and helpful Also last problem which was based on the article made me more focused on the supplemental readings for the class I felt like my knowledge was more broadened and improved in Big Data One thing I was happiest about was that all the problems were coming from lecture readings and other supplemental sources I hope other homework to be similar format to this one I really enjoyed this homework 
90BDE5	7	neutral	 This homework was not as bad as I thought it was going to be Even though there some parts that I stumbled on I m glad I was still able to complete the assignment This homework was the first time that I had to go to office hours because I didn t originally understand a concept but now I m glad that I went 
926B15	1	negative	 I was not a big fan of this assignment It was not really because of that fact that it was homework Instead I felt it was more of busy work The question I did appreciate though was question because it definitely required some deeper thinking The last question was also a bit frustrating because I felt the article was somewhat hard to read 
936218	4	positive	 This homework is a little frustrating for me since I have to figure out how to use distributed cach I spent a lot of time debugging the problem trying different options So it is challenging and interesting for me Also this work needs a lot of group discussion During the process I have found out many misunderstanding of the mapreduce job 
93EAE6	3	negative	 This homework was little bit hard in that we had to analyze all the process of Hadoop Mapreduce job execution It was a good opportunity to get to know different types of daemons and processes that run on master and worker nodes Also I was mostly interested in studying skew in times of various reduce functions and how difference in numbers of nodes or tasks could affect the skew It was pretty hard but greatly helpful in that I could be more familiar with the concepts of skew and other reduce or map functions Describing all the process of Hadoop Yarn job execution was pretty hard but helped me understand the material thoroughly 
951C52	5	positive	 This homework was easier and less work than the previous homework The coding part was quite repetitive since it was implementing the Tool Runner on the Driver and then coding the Mapper and using the same Reducer as the WordCount There were some conceptual questions that was quite hard to think of at first Also calculating the communication cost was quite confusing at first becase I struggled to figure out which numbers to use 
95C089	1	positive	  I not very like this homework but I fully understand how important it is Since it s the beginning of this semester so we need to learn some basic knowledge about big data and data mining etc I think the article that assigned to read is a little boring I prefer to learn new knowledge from the class slides However I like the question in homework one since the math model makes me know the knowledge better I design the math formula myself I like the designing process I learn a lot of things from the model 
963CB2	6	positive	 I really liked this assignment alot more than the other assignments The reason is because doing the previous lab greatly helped the speed in which I was able to finish the homework This is the first time that I had finished the homework before the preliminary deadline Even though it was because I had alot more time on my hands the other reason was because I just happened to start working on the lab and then glancing over the homework I realized I was aleady almost done with it 
96EDFF	4	neutral	 I thought this homework was interesting I definitely found it harder than the other homeworks thus far but it was  nice that it was so procedural The directions for this homework were very clear However I found it very hard to find the information needed to answer some of the questions as that information was scattered across mutliple powerpoints from class It was definitely a homework that built upon our classwork Lastly I liked that it was so  hands on and less conceptual than some of our other homeworks have been so far  
9779C4	3	positive	 The hw is generally a satisfying process for me since I did not encounter any difficulty All it needs is that you should go through course materials carefully which is quite enjoyable thing for me I really appreciate this one Hope that further hw have the same style as this one 
983EBD	6	positive	 This homework is exactly a useful and simple homework from the code example professor gives in lab we can simply produce the top N list by running two specified jobs And in problem we can implement combiner to make it efficient for us to run So I think this homework is a good one 
989321	1	neutral	 This homework introduced a lot of material that was new but served as the basis for a lot of the material in the class While it was mostly new material I enjoyed learning about Bonferroni s principle Sometimes the homework was ambiguous on what it was looking for as the answer Due to this answering some of the questions took a lot of time and thought and made it a bit overwhelming at times considering we have just started learning about the material I liked learning about the concepts in the homework 
993361	3	positive	 This homework provided good coverage of the material that has been covered so far in the course Second question was a tricky one and made me think harder to understand more about skew problem The third question was also a good one where it asked about YARN scheduler in detail and forced me to research it in depth to understand the concepts Overall I am quite satisfied with the homework  
9A1D3E	9	negative	 This homework assignment was pretty long though we did have an extra week to do it I found problem one to be fairly straight forward Problem was probably the most difficult and took by far the longest amount of time Problem was a simple implementation similar to the previous assignment just changing the file extension from html to jpg Problems and felt like the same problem and were also easy to do after having worked on the lab since the tasks needed to be accomplished were similar 
9AFCA0	2	positive	 This is a comprehensive homework In problem I was asked to use the virtual HDFS which helps me to understand how to work with Hadoop in a more real setting The other subquestions helped me to better understand how data is stored and managed in HDFS and what are the advantages and disadvantages of such storage system Problem  are pretty much the same I like how the questions were asked Providing the input and output of each stages definitely helps to understand what each stage does 
9B19DC	5	neutral	 Homework is building up the tools we need to perform sentiment analysis I found the coding to be a bit more challenging For instance we had to implement our own parsing of the IP addresses as well as the iterator for performing a sliding window task I am interested to see how we pull this all together in a real world application like sentiment analysis  
9D4F09	1	neutral	 Homework is relatively easier than the later ones I suppose I think it is a good way for starting chewing on the materials of big data The first question is really great exercise to get a deep understanding of the properties of the data But it is tough for me to do so many probability calculation and read a very long paper 
9EAB19	5	positive	 This homework is an interesting one however it is not so difficult for us to complete It allows us to analyze the log data from a log file and help us to deal with a word co occurrence problem in our Shakespeare poems We write a lot of code in order to execute the MapReduce job so I think it is a good one 
9FE85A	1	negative	 This homework was a little ambiguous in my opinion There were many answers that had no clear answer which was fine but it was the fact that many definitions of certain things were unclear The last question was ver unclear The article was both hard to follow and unclear Therefore it was very hard to decipher what exactly the answers were to problem three as they were not explicity stated in the article 
A0CF02	3	neutral	 Problems and weren t terribly difficult or time consuming especially since we did the lab that problem is based off on in class For problem I had some difficulty in understanding the YARN process from the lecture and lecture slides alone I think it s difficult to follow a graphic and further clarification was needed Overall it didn t take a long time and I only struggled on understanding problem I don t necessarily understand why we focused on YARN this week I understand it s an under the hood concept but I guess I place more value on understanding what MapReduce does rather than Hadoop 
A10F74	2	positive	 Overall this homework gave a good overview of HDFS and related concepts I found the homework to be fairly balanced It was not as much theory as the first homework The Download file question was bit tricky to answer and made me think about the way tranfer of file in distributed file system happens 
A1B29C	2	positive	 I very much enjoyed this homework assignment I thought the mapreduce questions were very fun The first part that involved the readings were slightly tedious But overall I enjoyed this problem set and feel like I learned a lot from it On a scale of to I would rate this assignment a 
A22974	7	neutral	 This part is not hard but it is a bid confusing Especially for the first part in order to use the fileSplit you need to include some header Unfortunately Eclipse gives no clue Worsely there are two possible headers from two different versions of API with only one working This part takes me some time But I do think the last question is good it gives more intuition about the definition of similarity you cannot just plugin the formula you also need to think the meaning of the formula I think it makes sense But I do not like Problem a I think it s too straitforward to prove 
A29CE5	1	positive	 It took a little while for me to finish this homework The first two problems are quite interesting I discussed a lot with my partner and finally we reached consensus The reading material for problem is not that attractive for me It does not have the clear outline like other academic papers although it is not very long 
A49258	5	negative	 I am little bit confused with the purpose of this homework Most of it seems to be repeat of what we have done in past and is being applied in different context Unless I totally missed the point of the homework this homework seemed just recap of earlier work to me Overall I am not very satisfied with this homework  
A4C414	1	positive	  As a non engineering school student without strong computer science  background I appreciate your really really detailed intrudction to  environment setting and Linux command line It made things much simpler  than I expected    From my perspective this homework aims to help us understand a big picture of what data will we use and what questions we will answer using Cloud  Computing technique especially the third question I like that part and it s  quite helpful 
A53BC3	8	negative	 This assignment was a little frustrating with problem two since the activations relevant stub files were nowhere to be found and it took a few days to get them via Piazza Otherwise the assignment was not too difficult I felt that we could ve done more examples during class however though I guess this ended up being a minor exercise in searching through API documentation Question s one and three were both fairly straight forward in comparison 
A57CFB	5	positive	 In this homework I found the tasks interesting and engaging again The first problem went much smoother than I thought it would be thus making it less time consuming than I had originally thought The second problem was also straightforward though I did more than the problem was asking for so I had to backtrack in my code a bit Thus far I have enjoyed the coding assignments and am always keen on coding in Java 
A60DAF	9	positive	 In this homework the most challenging thing for me is the problem Although the problem not ask me writing a code for matrix vector multiplication but I still write for both method calculate normally and divided to stripes using spark And I realized that the datastructure using Rdd is more complicated than normal python Moreover due to unfamilier for the pyspark program this problem spent me a long time for answering the question But this homework really help me for deep understanding for pyspark program and job execution And also for the two algorithms for the pagerank 
A627C9	4	negative	 This homework is the most difficult one to finish I fail to finish all of the homework on time because I started too late At the begining I got stuck at the command line Spent almost one day to deal with this problem It is kind of frustrated Slides from the lecture seem not help a lot for me to finish the homework 
A653F3	5	negative	 For the first problem dude I supposed that we will have a walkthrough about Combiner Partitioner as well as customized Combiners But it turns out to be merely again implementation of simple MRs I know the key part is how to gradually test you program and make it scale up but I am doing this on AWS EC all the time So it just some repetition work for me honestly speaking  For the second problem that s not what a good problem should be No formal input and output design the simple testcase reveals nothing about abnormal cases And even the model is different from the resource we are provided Say we ought to get a WORD LIST and then find co occurance from a bunch of document That needs a time complexity of O N Instead we didn t have that list and what we need to do is iterating the whole text which made the complexity O N  
A65EEE	9	negative	 This homework is really really a huge work It takes me such a long time to think and debug it I really do not like this homework although it may help us a lot But last week we had an exam and I really regretted that I did not finish the homework before exam I am so sad 
A82D1E	9	positive	 The application of vector maxtrix multiplication in this example really helped with understanding PageRank and in general how vector matrix multiplication works using spark The PIG questions are also interesting because they represent real world data cleaning and applications of big data tools Only one more make up homework assignment to go 
A8775F	7	positive	 This homework is a rather easy one since it only requires one mapreduce job In addtion it requires less work in hashset which is required in the former homework In conclusion this one focus more on report than code so it is a relaxing one since we do not have to spend much time on debugging I would like to see more homework like this 
AA83FF	5	positive	 This assignment was by far my favorite in this class because I think it really pushed me to understand map reduce extremely thoroughly Now that I understand the concept and its actual implementation I m very looking foward to more sophisticated map reduce programs that require more complex computations Overall this lab didn t take too long and was very informative Thank you for this 
AAEA89	2	positive	 I felt much more confident on this homework than the last I feel very comfortable working on the command line so those questions engaged my interest I was a bit skeptical and surprised on the ease of difficulty of questions and as they seemed to be very short after spending so much time on question 
AC86DC	8	positive	 This homework is a good homework it help us to review the basic command of Spark and leading us to handle the log data and the XML file by using Spark By doing this we can extract and load the desired information from certain files So I think this homework is really good 
ACB0E9	1	positive	 The first problem in the homework gave us basic understanding of the properties of big data We got to review the slides and give the answers This is helpful because the concepts are more solid The second question was more technical and involved calculating probabilities The example in the book helped a lot and the hint enabled us to check out answers which was very useful The third problem was more like a reading comprehension problem We got to know more about data from that question 
AD5432	1	neutral	 The homework was not particularly difficult or time consuming I had more issues acquainting myself with the turn in process in Gradescope than the problems Altogether the material from lectures and the MMD book was sufficient to complete the homework I will comment that problem was worded rather ambiguously where I didn t know what was meant when it referred to Data based approach This was later clarified by Professor Neumann on a Piazza post but I think it could be worded better 
AE02BB	8	neutral	 I thought this homework was on the easier side I really enjoy working with spark so much more than with Hadoop map reduce It is easy to explore the data and developer time is reduced so much I though the wording in some parts of the second question could be improved because it was a bit vague
AE563E	6	positive	 This assignment was really helpful in that I could be more familiar with the concepts of combiner and reducer I could learn more about the efficiency of combiner through working on the lab and seeing the difference in results from the case when there is combiner and the case when there is no combiner Conceputally I could understand thoroughly in the lectures however I was not familiar in technical and practical way so I think this assignment was really meaningful and beneficial I think there is further a lot of learn about Hadoop reducer mapper and combiner I really liked doing this assignment with my partner we discussed a lot and worked on coding as a great time I m looking forward to doing the next one and I was really thankful for this practical assignment 
AE82CE	2	neutral	 For HW I thought the questions were very reasonable They were based off information given in the slides and in the textbook so I had little difficulty in completing the assignment The homework did not take a long time and I m satisfied with my understanding of the material covered in this section 
AE9493	3	positive	 This homework is mostly focused on examining the data flow of MapReduce job execution the concepts of resource manager and node managers and the job execution practice in Hadoop It is a very comprehensive and wisely designed assignment It covers every important corners of what has been taught in class And it combines real practice and understanding of core concepts which allows students to effectively review the course contents Particularly those questions can help students spot the most important content appearing in the textbook and pretty well encourage students to read the books in depth I like this homework a lot 
AF2F82	4	positive	 this homework is quite easy once you understood all the material in the slides There are questions on piazza about certain aspect of the homework which can be answered easily by referring back to the lecture slides But people dont do that They prefer cookie cutter answer Pathetic I wished the homework could be morre challenging but it s quite easy This takes no time at all 
AFB368	8	positive	 Coming into this lab at first I wasn t sure of how exactly spark will help us with our programs However as me and my partner went through the lab and hw we were able to see how our data from hdfs formats itself into RDD and how we can use transformations and actions to get our desired output Like the previous labs I found this one very educational and highly prooductive Thanks 
AFC689	3	positive	 Homework was more of the same Easy questions no coding I know the next homework will have some coding and understand that the infrastructure piece of Hadoop is clearly important to understand but I m excited to get back to coding Answering questions that are easily googleable doesn t do much for me I am happy that these homweorkds give us an opportunity to boost our homework score early in the class 
B005E4	2	positive	 This homework is easy to finish if you have finished reading slides and the required parts of the books It is helpful to do exercises like problem and to understand how the MapReduce system works The amount of work is just right This homework makes me feel more confident about this course 
B07BFE	8	negative	 I don t really like this homework as for me it is boring I feel the only thing I do is uploading data or typying some boring script lines Really don t like it It s not bad to have a shorter homeword one week before the midterm but I still think this homework boring Maybe it s better to put it into a lab or studio section Overall pretty boring homework especially for problem and problem 
B10348	3	neutral	 I enjoyed this homework mostly due to the focus on implementation I think this was the first homework where we implemented all the classes from scratch  I spent more time than I would have liked on part since I wasn t really sure how to make the mapper class check for the set parameter 
B1B148	7	positive	 Homework dues two week after assigned which made me think that it requires a lot of work But fortunately there are not many coding tasks Instead it includes some conceptual questions and math computation problems The last problem is really good for us to understand the process of collaborative filtering without actually implementing it I m still not sure my answers are right for this one 
B1EFF6	8	positive	 This homework was fun I like using pyspark much much much more than implementing mapreduce using the hadoop framework It s also speedier and we don t need to move around data to process it I had a little trouble understanding problem at first but i think i figured it out in the end there s a difference between activations and activation I think I implemented my answer correctly but my final saved file is over Mbs long which I m not sure is correct It seems too big for entries to be honest 
B2C0A7	7	positive	 I think this time the homework is similar with the word count but there is something new for the code part And I spent some time work on the new stuff Actually when I took the lecture I still have some confusion with the slides But when I finish it I get it I think 
B360C8	6	positive	 It was interesting to build a MapReduce pipeline purely from scratch though with significant resources proposed for reference on how to get started and a lot of the code was similar to that previously written This wasn t necessarily a bad thing though since I think it helps to become more comfortable with using Hadoop A few of the conceptual questions were tricky to think of good examples of however 
B4113C	6	neutral	 I thought this homework was relatively challenging It was quite annoying to have to change our toolrunner file for each test between the different jobs Howevever I did find this assignment quite interesting as we were using mapreduce to determine information that is potentially used in all of our day to day lives such as in netflix Overall I thought this homework was hard but rewarding 
B44498	6	negative	 I was a little confused about the part about caching the responses of the movie identifications to the movie titles The teaching assistant was not super helpful lin this instance I wish I could have worked more closely with my partner on this one That is something I will learn from the future 
B52039	8	positive	 In general I like doing homework The first and second problem are very interesting They help me to understand more about how to create RDD data in Scala spark They also help me to be more fluent with spark transformations and actions Meanwhile the last problem helps me to understand more about pipelining in spark the reason while spark is fast etc 
B664C9	3	positive	 Homework of this week is mainly focus on comprehension of the concept Most of the solution can be found on the textbook or slides It is easy to solve problems after with the help of reading materials The lab part is also easy to deal with so far The workload is just enough Feel pleasure to finish homework before next class 
B67E09	6	negative	 Homework is really a tough job for me It took me almost three hours to finish the first problem And the virtual machine crushed for several times when I was working on it The accidental exit of the virtual machine will make the history of the command lines disappear which is disappointing I must make the snapshot in case something is going wrong 
B73608	2	positive	 I think this one is better than the previous one Specifically problem helps us to remind some hadoop commands and forces us to read some material in the book and the material helps us to better understand the tradeoffs between block size and several factors Problem and Problem is kinda the same but as this is the main concept for this week I think it s fine Overall I think this homework is good it will be better if you can give me a good mark lol
B8521A	2	positive	 I thought that this homework was adequately difficult I preffered it to last weeks homework as I thought the MapReduce problems had a more direct application to the material we were learning in class It also built on in class assignments which I thought was good It was interesting to finally utelize the shakespeare folder that we d set up a couple of classes ago Overall I thought this homework was better suited than the last and wasn t too difficult to complete 
B8F5A7	3	positive	 Similar to homework homework was also fairly easy Since they were mostly about understading the concepts from the book and lecture it was easy to answer them after either reading the book or looking back at the class slides Problem one was easy because I had already done the lab to get the results and the rest were just conceptual Problem two was easy after reading the book Lastly problem three was easy if you knew what each of the daemons are in charge of 
BA60C8	1	negative	 I found that problem was really open ended and a lot is left for the interpretation of the student I am hopeful that I explained my interpretation with sufficient detail Problem I found to be challenging It has been a long time since I have applied statistics in this way The principal itself is very useful but I found the equation to be complex For Problem I enjoyed the article and I believe it shows how the volume and variety of data can be just as or more powerfule than having complex anlaytical algorithms 
BA743C	9	negative	 This homework truly requires much effort since we need not only to use pagerank in spark but also pig scripts It is really a challenge However some of the questions are based on slides so they are not difficult In all this homework is a little too difficult for me since I got stuck at the pig scripts which frustrates me a lot 
BABF65	6	positive	 Top N list is something very cool I feel like I m touching the  nature of those mysterious and magic applications I saw in the  daily life Although implementations like top N list can be done  much much more easily in other statistics languages such as R  and SAS than Hadoop but it s more than excited to me when I  noticed that I could handle enormous size of data 
BB6720	9	positive	 This latest homework was very interesting The various ways to do data analysis are very interesting It is a subject that is constant evolving and even in class we noted that PIG is quickly disappearing I would like to see more hands on approaches with the data though Data wrangling and manipulation is one of the more complicated time consuming efforts with big data analysis 
BC2C01	9	negative	 This homework was ridiculously long and somewhat difficult It is probably one of my least favorite homework Each problem was separated into multiple parts and some were challenging so it took a long time to figure some of the problems out I definitely did not enjoy this homework at all Even though we had two weeks to finish it the first week was exam week so it was hard to work on this homework on top of studying for the exam 
BD28CA	2	negative	 Homework requires us have a detailed realization of Hadoop Distributed Filesystem HDFS how are the data files  stored in data nodes how to extract required information and more importantly how does MapReduce tasks work  All above are essential to followed studies But there is a thing most of questions in problem are based on the  lecture materials which I think should be answered base on the insights of lecture slides and textbook So it would  be better if there are more open questions where we can share our thoughts  
BF9F10	2	positive	 I thought the homework was good overall It was very good to work through map reduce by myself It really solidified my understanding of map reduce I wish we were required to also to the group and combine step so that I could have a more thorough understanding I also like doing the cluster state diagram 
C157DD	5	neutral	 This homework was straightforward for the most part I didn t have trouble with implementation or design although conceptual problems did take more thought I used lecture slides to answer most of them and bounced ideas with my group mates during lab when we talked about the homework Do graders really read this I doubt it so for the sake of diversifying sentiment analysis BANANA PEAR APPLE GRAPEFRUIT KIWI PAPAYA MELON CANTALOUPE LYCHEE PINEAPPLE STRAWBERRY BLUEBERRY BLACKBERRY RASPBERRY ORANGE WATERMELON TANGERINE MANDARINE TANGELO PENGUIN
C1903A	7	positive	 This homework was enjoyable to complete It provided a lot of practice in applications of MapReduce and big data Applying our skill towards comparing similarities in data was fun to complete Since big data is very useful in many different fields I felt that this homework helped me to learn more about how the concepts are used in the real world This homework also allowed me to come up with possible ideas for projects I can make using the skills learned in this class Overall I liked this homework a lot 
C25F59	9	negative	 This homework is a very large work i spend the whole weekland on it i have confused about the first question for problem it require me to describe generate sample dataset using pig or not i don t know what is sample dataset is it the toy test data or is the final data being dealt with by pig or mapreduce i consider it as the final data if it is just the toy test data i don t know how to generate it using pig for problem it always occur an error that i can t order the group i using order xx by do i have another choice to sort the group 
C39830	3	positive	 I did not like this homework assignment Before continuing I though the first problem and the third problem were alright and I feel fine about the concepts discussed in them However I disliked problem three and think it is poorly worded and open to several interpretations In addition I didn t feel that skew was covered enough in the course The little blurb in the mmds book isn t detailed enough and I d like to have seen some explicit examples discussed 
C3A20F	6	negative	  I found this hw assignment much more challenging than previous assignments Implementing the combiner was quite simpler than having to implement the TopNList I would prefer to have only implemented driver rather than drivers to simplify the assignment and not have to run multiple commands in command line in order to test my implementation 
C4293D	8	neutral	 This homework was again equally frustrating and enjoyable I am enjoying learning spark especially the operations and transformations I ve realized that I like working with data sets and manipulating transforming data What s more I m excited about learning spark I decided to go with spark rather than python withthe idea of trying to add another language to my arsenal The frustrating part was just scrambling to finish everything in time which is partly my fault Virtual box and svn gave me issues again which is getting old but all in all I ve enjoyed working with spark so far 
C4B8D8	1	negative	 I thought the homework set was challenging but was still quite doable I enjoyed working on Problem the most mainly because it was the most challenging and provided a kind of problem that I have not encountered before I thought Problem was vague in its directions and it was confusing to follow One of the examples is very vague I thought Problem was simple because it was regurgitating what we read in the article However I thought the article was very informative and a great introduction into analyzing big data 
C4E3DB	6	neutral	 Since this homework was primarily a copy of lab it was a very quick homework I think implementation of the map reduce job with combiners was fairly straightforward and the example code in the Github account was very helpful in understanding some of the ways we can implement a TopN list One think that could have been clarified was whether it was safe to use a TreeMap for easy sorting I think I could implement use a MinHeap but at the same time do I want to when Java has a ready to use TreeMap and the probability that very popular titles have the exact same ranking is low   Again are these reviews actually read PUMPKIN SQUASH ZUCCHINI SPINACH BUTTERNUT SQUASH CORN MAIZE TOTORO
C4E785	6	positive	 Homework introduced new challenges especially in regards to the JAVA implementation of the topNList Map Reduce jobs The jobs required using more complex data structures to hold the top N items in a list The combiner was a great example of how to improve Map Reduce efficiency I think the combiner we will be very useful when developing Map Reduce applications in the real world  
C52136	5	neutral	 I did not think this homework was that bad I do believe it was a slightly harder than the previous homework because I did not really give myself enough time to finish the homework to the best of my ability If I read the slides in more depth then the homework would not have been too bad Also I feel like this homework contained a bit more theoretical questions than I would have liked 
C59FFE	6	negative	 This time I took many time to debug At the beginning the code can run on local but cannot work on cluster Finally due to a small implement error Although I took a long time to debug error but it is value to me to be careful to code in future And this assignment is interesting as well 
C616EF	4	positive	 This homework was a good hands on about configuration and partitioner handling in hadoop It provided good background in these two areas to understand how configuration handling and partition logic works in Haoop Overall the homework was fairly balanced its hard for me to say it was easy or hard Overall I am quite satisfied with this homework  
C6F775	2	positive	 The difficulty for this homework is easy It requires you some basic conception about MapReduce and HDFS which has been taught clearly by the professor last week Furthermore it requires you to read the textbook to find out advantages and disadvantages of HDFS which is really useful for career development I am totally glad for that 
C78FC8	5	positive	 Hw is easier compared with the last homework It can be done fluently after finishing the previous lab Some of the definitions are not very clear according to the slides I also had problems with the grammar of coding I was able to figure them out by searching them on the web or reading the book 
C79952	8	neutral	 This homework assignment wasn t too bad I felt like it was a good introduction to Spark However some of the questions I felt were pretty vague We had to go to TA hours just to ask if one of the questions is what you were looking for It s a bit annoying when a question is open ended or vague but the graders expect a specific answer I feel like I understand everything conceptually it s just a matter of figuring out exactly what the questions are asking 
C885F9	3	positive	 I found the homework this week to be helpful in understanding the Hadoop MapReduce structure I felt pretty confident on my answers this week and unlike the previous homeworks was sure I was giving the answer the questions were looking for I find it fun and enjoyable whenever asked to perform Hadoop commands or Unix commands 
C9963B	4	negative	 This homework involves more coding than the previous homeworks Although we do not have to write a lot of lines we really need to understand the concepts before we can start the homework The homework helps connect the concepts together so it is very helpful However it would be better if there were more examples in class so that we know more clearly what to expect Once we clearly understand the material then it actually does not take too much time to complete this assignment 
C9DE22	1	positive	 I like the first problem It definitely helped me to better understand the properties of big data By comparing different data types I start to realize each type pose its unique challenges to processing Before getting started on analysis understanding the properties of data is a vital step Problem warns us that we need to be cautious when mining big data Improper test criteria can easily lead to false positive results I don t quite like the reading That article is not well written from a layman s perspective There re way too many field specific terms and jargons The worst thing is the logical flow is pretty bad One can hardly see the structure of the article 
CB6952	9	negative	 I was not really a fan of this homework One reason is because the assignement was alot longer than usual As a whole though the assignment was not too bad The only question that was absolutely brutal was problem because there could have been many solutions I also wasn t very comfortable with the communication cost part so it took some time to derive the equation 
CDA010	1	positive	 Personally HW is really meaningful for us to understand what is bigdata and the properties of them But for us international student the difficulty of this class may not the thing about big data but the English The reading material is a little bit long that cost us much time to understand But it is still good for developing our English reading skill The other point is if I know what is x y Question I can finish this homework more quickly I only know C x y 
D14442	7	positive	 I had fun in this homework It was neat being able to tackle recommendation systems from another angle this time comparing user similarities for a better recommendation Though this took much longer than I anticipated I feel this was probably the most rewarding homework performed so far I m looking forward into more ways to manipulate large amounts of data 
D1C763	7	negative	 This homework was again stressful because I procrastinated I liked the Jaccard similarity and other similarity calculations there was some straight math calculations for a change as opposed to conceptual problems or programming mapreduce functions which we actually did once in this homework I m also enjoyed learning the new input split practice where a file can be read in directly as a key value pair It made the job in problem much easier 
D2DCDD	3	positive	 This homework help us to understand and remember the context we learned last lecture It is very easy to forget if we only type the command in lab but in this homework we have to review the progress of lab and this time we can remember the command and process more clearly And the second question is also help us to understand what is skew and how to reduce the inpact from it The problem give us a situation to let us think about skew and which situation is more likly to have a skew 
D3CD10	8	positive	 This homework is easy compared to the last one I really like Spark It does simplify my programming and train of thoughts Now I can have a big picture of the program and make it work at the same time This is a really powerful concept I know that pipelining is nothing new it dated back to the early linux days But to realize first hand how powerful it is is just fascinating 
D43E51	9	positive	 Hw is quite a lot of questions which is quite time consuming It start from spark applicarion pagerank to pig Actually the question is not that hard and you can figure it out when you get familiar with the tools One thing that need to becareful is to understand what the question is asking and what is the requirement Then the other should be fine 
D4EF0F	4	positive	 I enjoyed working on this lab a lot It took much longer than the previous labs I had a hard time working with distributed caches and tool runner Most of my time was spent debugging the code It was cool to see the sentiment analysis although we were looking at it word by word with no regard to context or frequency Hopefully we ll be doing more stuff like this later on in the semester 
D642E3	4	positive	 This homework examines the students capability of implementing a specific hadoop partitioner passing parameters in command line and debugging the hadoop program It requires understanding of how the partitioner works in the loop of the hadoop MapReduce program and how to add side data via distributed cache This homework is satisfactory in terms of letting students practice coding for different parts in hadoop MapReduce And another good thing is that the common Java API is tested in the coding process I think this one is well designed and worth spending time 
D6C5B6	6	positive	 Hw helps us to develop a hadoop project from scratch It is quite meaningful although there are still some details which need to take some time to figure out how it is going on For example I use scanner to read the movieId as well as titles from movie title txt and put it into a treemap but it seems during the excution of hadoop there are some titles missing in the treemap which is replaced by null and it affect my running result Hopefully I can figure out why is that 
D9DE09	4	positive	 Hw contains quite a lot of coding It is not that hard to complete the requirement but I think the vitual machine is working weirdly I means inconsistent Sometimes when I run my project using the toolrunner it fail but the other time I run it it succeed I don t know the reason for that but it is not really friendly indeed 
DA07F1	3	neutral	 This homework is fairly short compared to the last one However it requires some deep reading Not only do I need to read I also have to understand beyond what the book tells me I like how question makes me think about how the entire hadoop map reduce framework works I guess that s ok since we need to understand deep enough for the test and also for the future work that we re going to be doing 
DAEB2F	1	positive	 For the first homework i spend three to four hours to read the relevent articles and ppt But i still have some confuse about the difference between the structure and complexity properties for data points is that mean that for the structured data points there has some fixed relationship inside the data  but what about the complexity for the data points  And i still have confused about if we label data just for easy understanding about that kind of data Why we need to annoate data and the unlabeled data can t be read by human being 
DAED68	7	neutral	 Spent one day on this homework For problem one once had problem with getting the file name The reason is the wrong version of the FileSplit is imported The main part of the code is not very difficult I was able to figure out it easily But always make mistakes on details Need more practice 
DAEE64	2	positive	 This homework was fairly easy and did not take long It was very straightforward and easy to understand and solve Problem one took a little more time than the other two problems just because there were several conceptual questions that required looking up in the book Other than that the diagram was easy to draw For both problems two and three it was easy and quick Overall this homework was very nice and easy 
DB2519	8	negative	 In this homework we practiced some spark operations It was a little confusing as to the differences between map and flatMap It would be helpful if there were more examples presented in class to show how to use different transformations Also in the error messages there were terms that we did not know their difinitions It took some time to figure out that the error was and how to fix them Overall the homework was a good exercise to get us familiar with spark 
DE0027	2	positive	 This homework is very helpful in terms of the usage of HDFS commands and understanding of MapReduce It has been a while since the first lab there we tried various Hadoop commands In order to finish the first part of the homework I have to go to lab instructions to look for the commands to use It is a good way to getting familiar with the commands The MapReduce exercises give us good hands on experience of the process These are useful examples of how MapReduce works and I can get a better understanding of it 
DE33C4	6	positive	 This homework was bit hard to implement However the link to the github website made it relatively easier once I went through the code there I am quite happy with this home work It game me chance to play around with netflix data which is great The second part was also good exercise to compare the run with and without combiner to show the rate in input output 
DE4FFB	7	positive	 Through this assignment we were both better able to understand the various implementations of map reduce programs and how we can fully benefit through normalizing The biggest challenge was retrieving the current file name from our mapper the textbook was of immense help as it very clearly outlined the step by step procedure of what needs to happen Thank you 
DEE057	7	negative	 This homework is not that hard than previous one But I had  several confusions in understanding the questions For example  problem a it s a one step derivation from cosine similarity  to Pearson Correlation So I have no idea what does the requirement   show formally ask for However except this minor defect I  felt like this assignment expects more open ended answers which is  the form of questions I prefer and feel at ease 
DF5CE6	1	positive	 In general I enjoy the first homework It is an affordable homework not too hard to start a semester Personally I like the first two problems The first problem help me to understand the concept and properties of Big data while the second problem is pure Math and I like Math I don t really like the last problem since I think the article is not really interesting and the structure of the article is also not too clear for me 
E1FCDA	4	negative	 This homework is significantly more time consuming and challenging than previus  We spent several days to understand how toolrunner and partitioner work and get  familiar to the environment of Hadoop The bad thing is from the bery beginnig  We suffer a lot to figure put the construction of Partitiioner But once we had  a fundamental realization everything gets easier and easier Besides I appreciate  all the valuable helps from Dr Neumann TAs and classmates 
E23940	4	negative	 Me and my lab partner Andy Dohoon Kim couldn t find enough time in our schedule to complete this assignment We apologize for not being able to meet the deadline and we will make sure to complete it for practice and submit the make up lab later in the semester Thank you 
E302CA	9	negative	 This homework is a really long and complex homework it contains much more knowledge than homework we did before Firstly it helps us review the PageRank in paper and pen Secondly it allows us to implement a Spark application to count the number of JPG requests Finally we use pig script to analyze the ad data 
E52191	8	negative	 Spark is pretty neat once you get the hang of it But I still don t understand how to run pyspark files shouldn t I just save them as normal python files with an import pyspark on it and while the activation models worked i m still confused how it actually did Wording on this problem was weiird 
E613A9	2	positive	 Homework two is not so hard I just need to read the textbook to get the knowledge of the HDFS And MapReduce is easier to understand by doing the last two questions I took much more less time to finish homework two than homework one It is a relief after doing such homework writing 
E706C0	8	positive	 Switching to pyspark has been a nice change of pace There is a bit more creativity using spark and specifically defining the functions used in pyspark The standard Java Map Reduce paradigm certainly has some shortcummings and faults The features of spark such as chaining pipelining and lazy loading make it much more efficient but also easier to work with 
E744D4	6	positive	 As the semester continues the topics and assignments in this course become more interesting I thought it was very interesting to create a TopN list using actual Netflix data I found the assignment to be very straighforward and was a little surprised that most of the first part of the assignment was completed in the lab work I m looking forward to the upcoming assignements where we will look at further methods for recommendation systems 
E9B27D	7	negative	 The homeworks are more interesting than the labs The labs possibly due to poor explanation and vague questioning are not as interesting However the homeworks are becoming more and more useful I am encouraged by the continued advancement of the course materials and look forward to continuing to learn I am more excited by the prospect of actually getting to write my own code and move out of the low level exampleslines
EADE34	7	positive	 I thought this homework was okay because the instructions were very clear and the information was accessible from the slides Information was present and able to be found unlike some previous homeworks It got completed and it was fine My partner and I worked very collaboratively together on this particular homework which was nice 
EBB60B	3	neutral	 I thought this homework assignment was less challenging for problems and  The assignment also got me more familiar with using Hadoop  However for problem a I was stuck trying to figure out where exactly the information I needed was to answer the question Also I did not know how specific you wanted us to be in answering where we find the locations for the input output and intermediate data  I even went through the log files in YARN to see where the input and output data were being copied to in temporary directories and files in YARN  Although I did find this assignment quite straightforward I did find some questions needed more clarification 
ECA31B	5	positive	 I thought that this homework assignment was fine It took longer than I had hoped but it wasn t terrible I liked having the simplified co occurrence before moving on to the more complicated way of doing it Although I did feel that some of the questions were a little vague and difficult to understand exactly what they were looking for Hopefully that doesn t affect our grade 
EDEB90	8	positive	 This homework consist a balcanced combination of coding and writing reports For the coding part the SPARK code are not difficult at all Instead the core code only needs one line to write Hence it is rather an easy part For the report I need to find answers on slides which helps a lot in reviewing the past courses It is a rather good homework 
EE85AE	5	negative	 It seems that this homework is far easier than previous one and we assumed we  could finish it in couples of hours But when we implemented our thoughts to  fulfil assignment requirements many practical problems arise For example in  problem we originally planned to split IP address with other words using  non character sign but the output is not exactly what it s supposed  to be Because log records is a huge file and contains semi structured data  so format of all the records is not totally consistent with each other Some  of them are split by Therefore our strategy failed to get the right  information This is big data is harder to handle than we expected 
EF48F8	3	positive	 This homework was much better than the previous two homeworks in my personal opinion The instructions were much more clear and resources were provided for certain questions such as pointing us to the correct place to learn about skew I thought questions two and three were of reasonable length but I thought question one was a little too long  
F1F61D	6	negative	 In general I really don t like homework The implementation parts are interesting However the theoretical questions are very boring particularly question part d I would prefer to have more implementation exercises rather than keep looking at the slides to answer the theoretical questions It take a lot of times and very boring 
F4ACB4	7	negative	 I didn t really like this assignment The first part was mostly about learning weird things that you can do in Hadoop It didn t seem particularly useful and we re creating a gigantic file at the end The other parts were very math focused but I feel like we didn t really have enough information to answer the questions The answers were either directly in the slides or glossed over and unintuitive Hopefully the assignments will be better once we move away from Hadoop 
F4FE63	8	positive	 This homework thoroughly examines the understanding of single and pair RDD and the application of Spark shell Especially the problem lets students know the flexibility of Spark in terms of transforming RDDs Problem strengthens the understanding of an important feature of Spark transformations So this homework is a successful example covering both concepts and practice 
F580A9	4	positive	 I actually liked this assignment alot more than the other assignments The reason is because this assignment was more application coding based The questions weren t really based on theory Instead all I had to do was refer to the slides and actually implement the code myself Even though I made silly errors which delayed my progress I m glad I was able to get through to the end 
F96A4E	1	positive	 Overall the first assignment was a very useful exercise because it required our group to carefully read the textbook and think hard about what the most suiting property for each data example was I am looking forward to the future labs as I find these exercises extremely helpful as they can t be solved unless we actually do the required readings 
F9C4EA	2	positive	 Personally I enjoy doing homework All the questions are pretty simple and straightforward Question requires a bit of reading which I don t really like but it helps me to understand more about Hadoop file system as well as storage Meanwhile question and help me to practice and understand more about the MapReduce process 
F9EA09	4	negative	 This was another cool assignment marred by unclear instructions   Take for example two questions in problem ask the question are there any differences in job execution This could refer to    differences in commands that the user executes to run the job  differences in job performance statistics e g number of bytes written time to run   differences in theoretical job execution e g what task runs on what machine   differences in the results the job produces  Or any combination of the above I ended up opting for a combination of and because it seemed the most likely In my opinion these kinds of ambiguities may seem trivial but ultimately ends up consuming a disproportional amount of time without actually furthering any understanding of the course material   Furthmore the instructions in Problem never mention adapting WordCount to run with ToolRunner but this seems to be a necessary step to use the command line file option to supply the required side data There are of course other ways of supplying side data to the distributed cache but both the textbook and the in class slides seem to be using a different version of Hadoop where Job has a method called addCacheFile   The provided stubs had a bunch of errors Nothing to difficult to correct but it was pretty offputting to import two course provided stubs and see Java syntax errors typos in variable names   On the positive side once you figure out what the instructions are asking the intended procedure is pretty neat and I feel like I have a better understanding of both ToolRunner and partitioners It just took about twice as long as necessary and I think this could have been avoided by being a little more explicit about what s expected 
FA8E7D	4	positive	 Homework required the implementation of several java classes and using existing classes to extend and implement new features Using ToolRunner demonstrates the power to add parameters and input files The Partitioner is exciting because it has taught us how to extend beyond basic Map Reduce algorithms This was also a good opportunity to worker closer with our group partners to come up with solutions to the coding challenges  
FB0247	8	positive	 This homework provided good overview of transformation and actions in Spark  I got to play around with multiple xml and logfiles to extract the required information  Initially the values transformation was bit tricky I was not able to find out how to get only value out of a map type RDD  Once I figured that out things went smooth Overall I am quite satisfied with this homework 
FBED05	5	neutral	 It is fair to say homework is easier than the former one There still are many coding tasks but this time we need to build a MapReduce job from the beginning It is important because we finally start creating our own jobs But now I am starting to worry about the closing exam 
FD8660	2	positive	 Problem and are relatively easy Problem took so much of my time though The collaboration on this homework is better than last time This homework also reveal a many details about how Distributed File System works The total time I spent on this homework is around hours I don t know if this is normal or too much 
FF8EFD	7	neutral	 I thought this was a decent homework The directions for number one could have been a little clearer I enjoyed gainer a better intuition for the similarity measure on the second problem The wording for the problems can be ambiguous at time I thought the third one was a little tricky but I did it nonetheless
