00708A	4	positive	 I was really stressed about this homework because of another class that is taking up way too much time But the homework itself was useful and I feel like I am catching my basic mistakes earlier This is also the first time I am using the extension for which I am very grateful thank you for having such a forgiving late policy Overall I feel good about this homework and would enjoy this class a lot more if my other class wasn t making me so miserable 
00B4D5	7	neutral	 I found this homework to be probably the most difficult one yet I enjoyed the challenge of writing a word co occurrence mapreduce program although I got frustrated because while troubleshooting with the given test sentence I wasn t getting the correct results Then I realized I had written the sentence wrong The second problem was tough because I have a hard time knowing what to right for pseudo code 
0114A4	5	negative	 I did not enjoy this homework There was not nearly enough guidance and it took me almost a week and a half to complete We did not go over the necessary materials to complete the task and I wish I understood more before starting this I lost my weekend to this assignment 
02B325	9	neutral	 This homework is good for practicing Pig and Spark and understanding some of their mechanism But I feel the Spark part is weak Problem requires to write a simple Spark program and problem is completed with a few lines either Also the job monitor for Spark is kind of broken I can only view stages and tasks when job is running I have no idea whether this is due to our pseudo cluster or it s Spark s defect 
033EFB	4	negative	 I got a big trouble doing this homework My laptop black screen when the virtual machine is running which broke the linux image and I have to install a new one The problem referred to setups in previous labs so I have to redo the lab and lab for the homework I don t like tasks based on previous ones Despite the accident this homework only consists of hand on practicing I think it s better than giving theoretical problems 
03F397	3	positive	 This week s assignment definitely helps me understand the class material better Plus I am really excited that we finally start coding I like coding in java Therefore I feel that question is pretty interesting and I am also amazed at how fast it processing data This week s assignment really makes me understand how useful this course is 
048B13	3	neutral	 Problem took me a lot of time to make it because I do not combine what I leaned from class and what I read from book together which means there are two things are different in my view but the same actually I felt so sad about it and TA helped me to make it I appreciate it  The problem is a good question for me to review knowledge about YARN which I did not quite understand just after the class but after studying the slides and book again and again I started to demonstrate some figure from the slides without the book It is an improvement right 
053B31	7	neutral	 This homework assignment is a little difficult and theoretical The first problem is simple program implementation but not that simple in the analysis of word co occurrence and its shortcomings The second problem is the most difficult one where students need to think about the pseudo code for matrix and vector multiplications in that the vector does not fit in the memory and we have to divide the vector and the matrix into stripes The illustration of the example is time consuming but worth thinking about the algorithm The pre processing is a bit ambiguous and there might be multiple possible approaches The communication cost is based on the pseudo code written before so if the pseudo code is not correct the calculation should also be wrong The third problem is not hard based on the information on the book MMDS we can easily get the results The matrix vector multiplication is time consuming so we wrote R programs to calculate the results 
055AAA	1	positive	 The first question of this homeoword was tricky in the fact that it there is no definitely correct answer The second question was very good It took a good amount of time but I feel like I really learned something from it The third question seemed a little pointless and the article was longer than necessary 
058728	9	negative	 This lab was relatively frustrating because it took many attempts to get any display output when the job was run on the yarn cluster as opposed to locally Also there were some troubles working with my virtual machine and the jobs were running extremely slow making it hard to test my scripts even the local sample data It was nice to have learned many new frameworks but I didn t like how many lab dependencies there were for this lab 
05AA72	3	neutral	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
06697F	4	positive	 In homework four my group member and I applied the tool to work on the nodes and code It is really helpful as it helps us adapting the tools available in this module Compared to no tools it is really easier for me to configure my files through command line if I am using the tools A helpful assignment is good and can benefit me a lot Generally this assignment is helpful and interesting 
06ACC3	2	positive	 The first problem of this homework is about the structure of HDFS a and b review the hadoop commands c review the structure for the data stored in clusters and the use of name node and master node Problem is about Mapreduce process It is not difficult once we understand the purpose of each step Next problem is similar to problem For the last problem we look up some material from internet and have a deeper understanding for mapreduce process 
075DE7	5	negative	 This morning I woke up tired My cat is in heat and was wailing all night long and since I knew this would keep me up I decided to read to facilitate sleep When I was sixteen and living with my father and stepmonster in Barrington we had this housecleaner who was in her early thirties She had instructions from the monster not to let me sleep late in the summers and impede her vacuuming schedule so she would knock on my door and I would pretend to be asleep 
0889E1	2	positive	 This homework seemed very applicable which made it much more exciting to complete  Many of the answers required lots of though and reading but once we came to an answer it was extremely rewarding The length was perfect and I feel as if I understand the mapreduce function much better after completing it 
09560D	6	negative	 This homework is really difficult It takes me a lot of time to finish it The most difficult part is the compressed file also how to read file into java This homework is really excited and a good sport I feel that I understand the structure of writable class Also the command line starts to become my new best friend I am in love with Linux 
0AF103	9	positive	  Homework Review   Zheng Yuan   Program   Its a great opportunity to know how to use pig to load data and how to use pig to process the dataset   Help us understand the difference between running pig on local disk and running pig on HDFS   Program   Help us know how to sorted the dataset in the order we want   Program   Help us understand how to use group and aggregation function count to do the statistic job  Program   Help us know how to use pyspark to load the data   Help us know how to create the rdd pair in the format we want   Program   Help us understand how to design the simple algorithm by using the transformation and action in spark   Help us understand the concept of stages and task and help us know how to check the tasks and stages state in our job   Help us understand the concept of pipelining and the situation we can use pipelining 
0BAF08	4	positive	 This homework reminds me of many common commands used in Linux and gives many chances to me to do MapReduce testing locally and on the clustering which is valuable However some questions are a little difficult to understand I am always wondering what the questions are exactly asking I think it is better to give some hints 
0DA480	1	positive	 I found the first problem very helpful and kind of interesting The three examples differ quite a bit from each other and that really helped me and my partner find out what concepts we were not very familiar with The second problem was a little intimidating at first sight The third problem felt like the longest because I m not used to reading articles for a CS class 
0E1CE0	2	positive	 I thoroughly enjoyed this homework more so than the first Maybe it was because I worked with a partner but I also found that this homework allowed me to more deeply understand the inner workings of the HDFS structure as well as the MapReduce process It was also quite cool to take a look at sentiment analysis which I m contributing to right now and come up with two nice ways to improve quality efficiency 
0F61E9	2	positive	 This homework is about the concepts of HDFS and MapReduce The first problem asks us to sketch the data storage on HDFS and describe the meta data which helps me better understanding the concept of data locality The second and third problems are related to MapReduce which clarify the functions of mapper and reducer The last one is based on some hand on experience of running a MapReduce job I believe it s valuable for engineering students 
0FB52A	8	positive	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
114073	8	negative	 Question number one on this homework was very lengthy and seemed uselessly redundant at times  The next few questions were very conceptually based though and this was very helpful for my understanding  The only drawback was question b since it required a huge amount of tedious work with brackets to an extent that seemed like it may be unnessecary to really help and understand the material 
125E26	6	positive	 My teammate and I started to work on the homework early this week We went the TA hours on Wednesday and found out it was really helpful not only for finishing the homework but also for understanding the material Plus we finally figured out what we did wrong in the last assignment 
1294FD	8	negative	 I have to admit that this homework is better than all past homeworks This one includes implementation from scratch which is very good and effective for us to understand how Map Reduce jobs work when we are solving real problems The problem and problem are focusing on the concepts and understanding of how recommendation systems work and how much we understand different schemes of evaluation of similarities This homework helps to go through all what we learn about the recommendation systems and it also gives us the opportunity to go thourgh the process of implementation of a map reduce job again It is fun and helpful 
1322F3	2	negative	 I would say that this homework worked well to solidate my understanding about Lab and Lab in which we learnt about the basic hadoop file system manipulation and basic MapReduce algorithm And through the other problems we deepened our understanding about the system provided functions in MapReduce process Also the instructions in labs has been detailed but limited time left in lecture to complete them which will become another type of homework 
144497	7	neutral	 In this homework we tried to figure out some real problem like sentimental analysis and webpage rank Although this homework is not very hard but I found that we only did some basic work in this area For example we only do the word co occurrence counting in problem but acutually this is not a very useful job in real problem and it will be more complex when doing sentimental analysis We also need to consider the time cost which may blow up if the input data is very huge 
1507A3	7	negative	 I think hw is a bit hard as the slides does not elaborate clearly as to how the MapReduce is implemented for matrix vector multiplication using stripe But I still figured out a way to understand it but not so sure about my answer Besides the concept of communication cost is also confusing in terms of what types of emits count here 
1548EC	3	negative	 I kind of have the same feeling for this homework as I did for the first homework The questions are qualitative and the answers are supposed to be descriptive leaving a lot of room for us I don t typically like these types of questions since I feel it is easy to miss a few points here and there due to the vagueness of the questions I do hope there would be more coding question in the future which would actually prepare us for the real world tasks 
15CAD7	8	positive	 In this homework I find it great Although I did not do the programming part But I can clearly understand how to calculate Jaccard similarity measure Pearson correlation cosine similarity And I learn the advantage of collaborative filtering approach that it has many modes to analyze the similarity between users and items What s more step by step to deal with item item similarity let me to connect MapReduce with calculation of similarity 
199B0D	5	neutral	 We defiinitely struggled a lot more than we should ve on this homework The stupid part was that we took like hours debugging a very stupid detail that was in the slides and that we should ve noticed way faster Well this is certainly a learning experience to always read carefully and pay attention to detail Also Piazza came in pretty clutch as one of the TAs was able to help spur us in the right direction to fix our little detail 
1A7B68	3	positive	 This was the first homework for this class for which we needed to write code It was a bit stressful at first when we were just starting because we were expecting the coding part to take several hours at least like in other CS classes As it turned out however it was not tedious at all and was kind of fun to know that we just wrote our first data analytics program Other than that the other two problems were just reviewing concepts that we ve learned in class so they were like OK 
1A9648	7	positive	 Homework was special in that it was a lot more focused on theories and algorithms Even though it was significantly more challenging than the previous ones in terms of math it was a helpful exercise to help us solidify our understanding of different kinds of applications of MapReduce programs and the mathematical basis of them 
1B8C1A	8	negative	 I really enjoyed designing and implementing my own MapReduce job from scratch It definitely reinforced the recommendation systems material we learned in lecture I do wish it walked us through a few of the steps though because it was pretty overwhelming to start with nothing The last problem was a real pain because of having to keep track of whether the movie id or user id were the keys or values since they would switch around depending on the job or whether it was a mapper or reducer 
1BBA43	3	positive	 This homework was a little bit tricky since the requirement was updated several times so I had to revise result from time to time Overall speaking the homework was fine Most of parts were coming from out previous lab or reading so I got familiar with concepts quickly The write up part of mapper reducer and driver was a little bit tricky and I did spend some time configuring and playing with Hadoop It was so fun just playing around and trying Hadoop I like playing around with Eclipse Hadoop and MapReduce 
1C24E5	8	positive	 In this homework we using mapReduce to deal with a real problem Recommendation system It is quite fun when implementing something to cope with the practical problem However I though that the mapReduce become more and more complex since in mapper and reducer only key value pairs can be accepted so for complex data we need to store more data in key or value and this make the procedure more difficult to read and understand 
1CEBA7	1	negative	 I was slightly unsure about question for some of the dimensions especially that of labels It s unclear to me when exactly there might be an unexplained variable in the data but I tried my best to reason things out Deriving the equation for Bonferroni s principle took me a little while to figure out but I eventually matched my answers with the few examples I was definitely frustrated by the article The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data because I felt it was very verbose to the point that it made the article hard to read and understand Answering the questions to the article was not easy for me 
1D3BB2	6	neutral	 This homework is more challenging than all the previous homework that we worked on It took us more than hours to finish the homework and we think it is difficult The code is running very slow on problem Our MR is also running so slow on our laptop so we are quite frustrated when doing this homework We hope to get an easier homework next time especially when we only have week for each homework 
1D6029	9	positive	 it is our last written homework in this semester and this time s homework is all about the Hive flume Spark which are higher level language than hadoop Mapreduce It is really useful to learn these stuffs I am glad that i take this course in this semester I learned so many cutting edge technologies here I am so so so so happy 
1DD981	9	positive	 For this homework my partner and I cooperate perfectly Since it is the end of the semester and there are so many stuffs we divided the homework and worked on each part Although there are some troubles during the process we figured out the solution successfully and learned a lot I am pretty sure I master most of the content in this course I am proud of myself I am ready to do the final project 
1DFA73	3	positive	 This homework assignment is about running a real MapReduce job in java As far as I am concerned this homework is a combination of previous labs Therefore with the solid memory of the previous contents this homework would not be a hard one to finish and it indeed does not has much difficulty in implementation However there are some challenging points in coding such as the division of numbers using different datatypes 
1FE6AF	4	neutral	 In my opinion homework is a bit more challenging compare to the other homework I and my partner took around hours to finish the assignment However I think the homework is useful for our learning and provide a lot of practical assignment It is practical assignment and also help us deepen our understanding of the MapReduce process I hope there will be more problem in the next homework that will be similar this homework 
220F3A	5	positive	 This time it is quite a hard implementation of combiner and partitioner It required a solid knowledge and understanding of what we have learnt in class But it is not a impossible homework assignment and it indeed does not has much difficulty in understanding However there are some challenging points in coding such as the using the distributed cache 
229B9F	6	neutral	 I think hw is not too hard but takes time to understand different concept of MR program such as Index SequenceFile etc It was consufing at first because the code setup was a little bit off and the execution is sort of different from previous MapReduce java programs But I still figured out a way to handle and debug it I am not so sure about the compression ratio but I used byte count of uncompression rate divided by compression rate 
237698	5	positive	 Since we did not finish the homework on time last week my teammate and I both try hard to finish this week s one on time The homework is harder than we expected However we still thought the class and labs were interesting and helpful We really enjoy this course so far 
2409FD	6	neutral	 This homework was super long and required a lot of coding I spent most of my time debugging codes and googling proper commands instead of answering questions This class started to become code oriented and the workload was becoming heavier The knowledge was fine but just required more time comitting compared with previous ones I need to manage my time properly for next homework since coding is taking more places than before 
26482A	2	positive	 This homework was a little bit better than the last homework but i still found this homework to be too easy There was not much critical thinking in terms of making map reduce programs I would have liked to be challenged more as i do not feel i am learning a ton from these two assignments I am understanding the material but would like little more practicality coding practice 
26EA9D	8	positive	 From this homwork I have a deeper understanding of the how the recommendition process also I get familar with the Pearson correlation and cosine similarity by proving their relationship By pointing out the input and output of the job and job i get a practical exercise for the process of finding similar users Thank you so much for the instuctor and all the TAs help Thank you so much 
2706A6	3	positive	 I pretty enjoy homework three Because we finally start to design a MapReduce program on the virtual machine This is so exciting I really enjoy doing the programming homework but not on the theoretical part Hope we could have more programming homework coming since homework three And wish to have less quizzes in the future Happy coding 
2737CF	1	positive	 I thought the homework was very helpful because it got to think about different properties of big data and how not all of these properties may apply to all types of big data In addition the exercise on the Bonferonni s Principle was also interesting as it points out the danger of randomness disguised as meaningful data from data mining 
287315	2	negative	 This homework is clear straightforward and easy to understand All the materials we need have been covered in lab After I looked through all the slides and followed the instructions I can solve all these problems using correct answer My partner and I have discussed on sentimental  analysis and we got different ideas so we worked out two suggestions  successfully It is very important to understand how MapReduce works  and I hope this homework will give me a fundamental basis for the  following assignments 
28B696	5	negative	 This homework is a little hard and I have struggling on it I have read the book and slides first and understood what combiner and partitioner are but still have trouble in implementing  them in codes My partner and I discussed a lot to work it out If more materials can be given to us it will be better 
29E6AD	3	positive	 The only question with this homework is the second question in problem The skewness is measured but not quantitatively I believe the professor should elaborate the skewness in reduce tasks and I think we need to have the solution to this one The Problem and are pretty straight forward and anyone who has followed the lab instructions can figure those out easily I strongly recommend the professor to explain about the skewness question in detail in class 
29F782	1	positive	 This homework is overall reasonable It is not too hard The content in it is covered within the material provided on the lecture or those book and paper mentioned in the homework One thing I have say is somehow the paper it mentioned is a bit long and may require more time for non native speaker to read and understand Also for summery it requies a deep understanding and hard for grading 
2ADC24	8	positive	 This lab is very interesting I got to work long hours with Jason together and Marion assumes that we know some shitty math about matrix Howevver we managed to finish this homework at last The code online was kinda helpful but I ended up did not use it Well I need words to get the extra credit so here they are words lol lol lol lol lol
2C0480	2	positive	 This homework was less stressful for several reasons First working with a partner helped I have trouble focusing while working alone so group work actually helps my productivity and efficiency Second I am getting better at LaTeX so the actual writeup took less time Third the questions were less theoretical and more practical and I thought provided a good review of what we covered in lectures and labs I am still a little worried about how I am doing since we haven t gotten feedback from hw yet but I definitely enjoyed this homework more than the first 
2D72E2	1	positive	 This is the first homework of cses and I worked with my partner for all of the three problems It was quite fun to collaborate with others We have many different opinions in problem since the problems seems do not have unique answer We shared our own ideas and discussed a lot of things In addition I like problem since it is very interesting 
2E3401	4	positive	 This homework is very useful especially the second one because it includes all aspects of the knowledge we have learned recently If you are not familiar with the materials professor taught on class you will have a hard time working this out My partner and I finished the programming part successfully but we still not quite sure about some written questions  Some terms have never been seen and it is hard to describe them 
2EC35A	1	positive	 Problem  I like problem because it is quite practical and open minded I use what I have learned from class directly to this problem and feel no stress since there is not one correct answer This problem strengthen my understanding of some basic concepts So my attitude to this problem is positive    Problem  This problem is an extension from evil doers example from textbook It is not too hard but still quite helpful I feel appreciated that the problem provides a hint of possible outcome which saves me a lot of time My attitude towards this is positive   Problem  I don t like this problem The paper is hard to read and seems have not too much connection with questions I feel struggled when I try to find the answer and get lost eventually I think it is negative 
300A6C	9	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to the use of PIG and Spark This homework give us a good chance to use the big data tools learnt in class by ourselves to deal with some real problems help us learn the techniques in particular 
310D53	3	positive	 In Homework first of all I think it helps me understand what skew is And at the same time understand the process that it assign word into different task Towards problem it make me have a clear view of source management and what is its advancement As for Problem it is a programming problem After coding I think it is easier to how map reduce work and how to use MadClass function and ReduceClass function 
3175CA	2	positive	 i feel homework is very fair in terms of difficulty if you follow the professor Neumann and understand the concepts about Mapreduce procusdures you can do well in homework and it will not take you so much time If the professor keeps asking homework questions like this i can expect I will learn a lot from this class 
31B28E	1	positive	 The thing I like about this homework is that it pushed me to really dig into the reading and comcepts covered in the course However I find the problem a bit ambiguous as to what we are asked to write about The paper required to read is also slightly abstruse without any guidance 
31C1AD	8	positive	 I like that in this homework we actually got to plan with real data data from netflex It is also very nice to implement the mapreduce job from scratch on our own I think there should be more exercises like this in the future I also like the fact that most of the structure of the code is given so that we have some framework to work with I do like this homework and hopefully the last few homeworks can be as lightweight and helpful as this 
31FED2	7	negative	 today i am having a very decent day but that is alright I just finished this hw so that is pretty chill I got some interviews coming up so hopefully ill get that job and not have to worry about doing so well on these homework Yea what a life that ll be no stress and job security what a dream So ill keep you updated on the job search and you can hear more in HW Peace Love Brussels sprouts The myth the man the legend Dr Asparagus 
3254F0	3	neutral	 This was quite a fun homework since we got a chance to write code It would ve been nice to know about junit test before I wrote my program I had to run a complete test hadoop test job just to verify if the test input had the right output If I could use the junit test that would ve been much faster I was a little confused on what to write for problem 
333FD7	1	positive	 This homework is not too hard to solve and it is quite useful to help me review the knowledge contained in sildes and materials But part e of the first question is a little bit annoying and I am not sure about my answer and talk a lot with my parterner about it Additionally reading the article for the last question is really time consuming 
35DDDC	6	positive	 In this homework we customer a WritableComparable class and learned how to write and read SequenceFiles as well as how to do file compression with SequenceFiles I think this is very useful for real practice We also compare the uncompressed data and compressed data in problem and found that the compression performs very well and it really make big sense in storing data when we need to use the data in the future 
36052C	4	positive	 In homework problem we implement a MapReduce program of log hits count In this problem we implement ToolRunner MRtest and run this program respectivly on local system pseudo distributed cluster first and check the results as well as thinking about whether the MapReduce program is ready for running on real Hadoop cluster or not This is a complete procedure for building MapReduce program However we still not familiar with how to debug and I am expecting the course tomorrow 
36BB67	3	positive	 I really enjoyed actually executing a MapReduce file albeit with a good amountof guidance and getting working results It was pretty satisfying to finish problem I definitely thought problems and were quite dry though I m very much looking forward to future labs where we do more complex MapReduce tasks and do more implementation writing code in Java I imagine it will be some fun stuff and hopefully transferable to my job this summer 
373A84	8	neutral	 The first problem of this homework need to implement at least two MapReduce jobs which is time consuming for us since we spend a lot of time on thinking the format of input and output to the mapper and reducer separately The second half require us to do a lot readings on the relevant bullet of knowledge In general this homework is huge 
3788AA	2	positive	 I actually enjoyed this homework I liked the questions that dealt with MapReduce the most because it applied concepts of what we learned in a simple manner without involving too much work The questions involving hadoop commands were good too It reinforced what we covered in lab and even took it a step further 
381B2E	6	positive	 This one took me longer than last one The question about what signatures are in the data confused me Do you want to know about what each part of the data stands for Or do you want to know what type of data is actually in the data file This is actually the fuzzy part The programming and debugging required by this homework is fine which means that it is not as challenging as the last homework I guess the problem and problem are more difficult than the last one but I actually get to learn something via doing them 
39C8BB	1	positive	 As a student who have literally no programming background I feel under great pressure However this first homework is not about programming but requires a lot of reading and thinking The reading material is too hard to understand and it took me almost two days to finish the reading and answering questions The second problem is interesting for me since i m a math major in college I hope to have more questions like this in future homework 
3C01B4	6	positive	 The problem is mainly about implementing custom WritableComparable type and the rest part of problem is similar as the homework assignment before Problem is about using SequenceFiles and File Compression It helps me a lot on using SequenceFiles The last problem helps me get familiar with an input format KeyValueTextInputFormat And it is useful and convenient to process some input data 
3D014B	2	positive	 hw review  Zheng Yuan    I think hw is a good oportunity for us to get familiar with not only the structure of the HDFS but also the process of MapReduce And we can also get some ideas about how to analysis the result of the output of MapReduce But there are some questions confused me in problem part d I have no idea about what the concise answer of the data transferring I find few things about it in the lecture pdf and textbook and I don t know what the question really means does it refers to the protocol or something else we need to answer 
3ED686	8	positive	 This homework assignment took a lot longer than expected I appreciated the fact that we were allowed to create out own MAPREDUCE project from scratch and test if it is correct This assignment was one of the most interesting so far because it proves that we have actually have the skills to analyze a real data set Overall this assignment was good but it did cause some stress 
3F2032	3	positive	 The first and second problems are very good ones They go through related problems and procedures of MapReduce job execution I encountered a type mismatch error while testing the last problem and have to go back to the previous slides and find the solution I like this kind of problem because you need an overall understanding of the course material but not just recent chapters 
403A2F	3	negative	 In this homework we began to write java code for mapReduce and implemented an average word length mapReduce task Although this is a very simple problem but I also fell excited when I finished it since this is a good starting However I am still fell uncomfortable in using eclipse in VM the speed is very slow and I also do not like the font in VM I am considering to finish the code in my local machine but it will be hard to debug and test so upset 
40572D	8	negative	 This assignment was a bit difficult to complete because there were some aspects that were included in the book that differed from instructions in the slides Many of the parts were a bit tedious too but I enjoyed being able to build a mapreduce job from scratch without the usual stubs files 
407575	2	negative	 I understand the basic premise of sentiment analysis but asking us to improve a word count program for sentiment analysis is another thing entirely It would have helped if we were given more examples on how others have improved their analysis on sentiment in their algorithms Overall the homework this time was rather straightforward if a bit confusing on what is required For example problem part a what do you mean by compute Are we not just finding the info for our key value pairs form the input data above 
411DFC	3	positive	 another well designed homework as I see it It helps me review concepts about map and reduce and hadoop distributed file system It integrates lecture materials and labs into one single homework which makes me feel satisfied after knowing I solve these problems using the knowledge I learnt in class 
41BE5B	5	positive	 This homework helps me review the lecture contents about combiner and partitioner which can improve the efficiency of MapReduce process I learn that when and where combiner and partitioner are necessary Through this homework I know how to build combiner and partitioner in MapReduce work in code Homework is a good combination of practice and class knowledge 
4258C3	9	positive	 This homework took a while to get past some Pig debugging I don t think that it provides extremely helpful error messages but I actually really enjoyed using Pig and Spark to execute jobs It s pretty cool to use these tools to greatly speed up our development time Spark is especially nice for obvious reasons Pretty cool hw overall though 
430945	2	positive	 This homework worked better than previous one Since most of the stuff were discussed in class or during lab time I didn t have much difficulties in getting the correct command I did spend some time reviewing the defination of Mapper and Reducer together with what input and output they have But overall speaking it worked well 
443186	6	positive	 Its been a rough week lets be honest And its just getting started This hw by far didn t make my life any better You ever get that feeling that you have to throw up but it just never happens That hows my week has been going and this hw was the coup de gras Tips for next weeks hw make it easier so i don t feel super terrible at the end of the week spending a lot of time on it Signing off captain crunch 
445D36	2	positive	  This problem tests some basic knowledge od command line I like this style but it is painful to gather the command line and results to Latex Also I feel confused about c it seems obvious but still hard to express   This problem test some MapReduce concepts as we did in lab I think it is good not too hard   This is quite similar to problem still testing some basic concepts of MapReduce I feel comfortable and relaxed when I am doing both problems   The first is good copying contents from terminal Still it is extremely hard to maintain the format when i am using a windows latex Nevertheless it is not a hard one So is the second one as well I don t like c and d I am lost about that  In sum I think hw is quite easy apart from a few point I feel good about it 
449894	8	negative	 I have a paper and another homework due this week and therefore I was busy with the other courses the whole week Also my teammate was really sick this week and so we did not start this homework until Friday This week s homework was hard than we expected and it took quite a long time for us to figure it out 
44E8F6	5	negative	 This homework was more difficult than the previous ones there was more to figure out with the Partitioner Also it was confusing at first that we didn t have a package in eclipse I thought it would be the partitioner package but this contained code related to log files not Word Count We got it done though this is the second time we ve used the late days and I m really happy the class has that policy 
459008	7	negative	 I m starting to feel pretty lost in the class but this homework was okay considering I get co occurrence matrix vector multiplication and PageRank a lot better now but I m not sure I could implement the last two Starting to worry about the exam coming up and unsure where to turn for help when the issue is really that I struggle to focus in class 
45D4F1	8	neutral	 This homework similar to other homework is in average difficulty level We spend most of the time on the first problem to do the MapReduce of the N list However we enjoy working on a because it help us understand the material discussed in class and gain hand on experience working on map reduce program Problem and is easier than problem In conclusion this is a helpful and interesting homework I hope we will have more interesting homework in the future 
473B93	6	neutral	 I liked this assignment because it introduced a new aspect of mapreduce which was sequence files and file compression Investigating the output files was very interesting and hlped me understand the material better The checking compression ratio was a bit tedious and the jobs took a very long time to run on hdfs However the output was nice and interesting to see for the inverse indexing 
477770	1	positive	  I worked on this homework with my partner For problem one we need to analyze properties of big data  Discussing and exchanging thoughts is a good way to solve this problem Although we had different thoughts on some aspects and may both be confused of some questions we thought over a lot and understood each property  more thoroughly For problem two I followed the instructions on the textbook and made a mistake on computing  days It confused me a couple of hours and made me feel disappointed Finally I found out the mistake and got the correct answer I should try to solve it following my own train of thought rather than just refer to textbook  For problem three it is hard to summarize a concept from a long paper and I read it carefully two times before I can find out the clues It is still difficult for me to extract information from a paper I hope I can make progress   This is not a difficult homework but it still asks for independent and through thinking 
477A25	1	neutral	 This homework took a long time for me because it was my first time typing an entire assignment in LaTeX Therefore I spent time setting up the document and learning syntax as well as actually solving the problems For problems and I wasn t always sure what the questions were getting at I hope I justified my answers well enough For problem I had some trouble deriving the formula and ended up reverse engineering it from the numerical solutions though I am not totally sure if my approach or result were correct The first homework in any class is tricky because it is hard to know what to expect 
484EF8	3	positive	 The homework is fair The first questions includes some thing not covered in the material but in the read chapter Also question is totally come from the lecture nodes and cost no time for solving Question is ok but just lot of practical mistake It improved the knoweldge we learned on the lecture 
48A099	4	negative	 This homework had vague questions like for Problem and Problem g I wasn t sure how to answer these because I didn t know what component I should consider I wish these questions were more straightforward I did enjoy doing more runs with Hadoop and writing MapReduce code Overall I wasn t as satisfied with this homework as I was with the others 
48C7F8	6	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to the serialization including transform the data into Writable and WritableComparable And learn more about the Sequencefile and compression including create and read the sequencefile and compress and decompress files And also the creating an Iverted Index 
48C91F	5	positive	 This is a very good homework assignment The first problem is related to the Combiner which will lead students to actually feel the advantages when using a combiner using statistics The second problem is more comprehensive to ask students to implement a Partitioner which will test the skills of students to develop a effective program to read words from given files and store them and finally use them to determine the partitions Both problems are clear and comprehensive 
48FDC3	3	positive	 This homework was kind of fun It involved acutally writing a mapreduce program which was more exciting than running one pre made for us It gave me a much better understanding of the whole system to work through a problem from the bottom up The first two problems were fairly boring though as they were straight off of the slides 
49E0B7	5	neutral	 This homework was bit of a challenge for me and took a lot of my time There were small errors that caused me to spend more time debugging than actually coding I feel like it gave me an understanding of how it is in the real world writing code for a large but only using simulated data Overall I thought this homework assignment was good and it did not cause me any stress 
49F0D2	7	positive	 In this homework I know how to use page rank to treat matrix including the process of the dividing of matrix However there is still some problems which is hard to understand For example it dose not confirm me that whether I need to write down MapReduce output or input This makes me very confuse 
4CB72D	2	neutral	 This was our second homework assignment and I felt satisfied after doing this assignment I can see the relationship between what we talk about in lecture and lab The homework was not challenging but took a couple hours to complete I felt like it tested my knowledge of the material while also challenging me in area that forced me to conduct research on my own to conclude the answer Overall great homework 
4D4BC7	2	neutral	 This homework is more comprehensive than the last one which makes student more familiar with basic and important concepts of HDFS and MapReduce It would be much better if more practices with programming or running MapReduce jobs are provided other than discussion questions Also it would be nice if students could have more data sets to practice with the MapReduce jobs not limited to word count program In sum this is a good homework assignment with comprehensive questions to be answered 
4D7946	7	neutral	 This is the week of spring break and both my partner and I are feeling very lazy when it comes to homework assignments Luckily we find this week s material on matrix operations rather easy to understand so the homework itself wasn t too much of a stretch However it still took us a long time to complete we submitted it late again 
4DBB72	2	positive	 Homework done in hour  That was the second homework for us I was not a difficult one It was about the HDFS and the mapReduce These concepts are important I learned what the hdfs is how the data stored and processed in hdfs how the mapReduce works what will be produced after mapReduce and so on 
4E0DE1	7	neutral	 This homework we did the problem Computing Word Co Occurrence This implementation is not very useful because only counting the words co occurrence directly next to each other cannot really receive the result which we desire in a document We also investigate the Maxtrix vector multiplication in MarReduce program Unlike the normal matrix operations we need to consider if the matrix and the vector are too big to be used by Hadoop 
4E8367	2	positive	  When I first headed the problems in homework I realized that if I finished doing lab and lab and if I listened carefully to the instructor in the class it was not hard or even quite easy for me to finish this homework So I finally decided to do the homework by myself And on the way I was doing my homework I found it a little confused in problem question and problem so I googled and finally got my answer All the time I took finishing this homework is about hours I hope the following homework can be as easy as this one 
4E8D42	9	negative	 For this time the homework is not complicated and quite easy It does not have much coding to do and the questions are pretty simple and straight forward For now it is only one homework to go So good luck with the last one Hope we could get another this time 
4F126B	4	positive	 This homework is hard It took me and my partner a lot of energy and time to figure out everything However it is really excited and a good sport I feel that I understand the structure of MapReduce and how the driver mapper and reducer toolrunner work much better Also the command line starts to become my new best friend I start to in love with Linux 
4F1BAE	3	neutral	 This was a tough homework because I didn t fully understand how to implement a mapreduce project since we haven t done one in class yet After some research I figured it out which was rewarding to be fair I learned about the practical implementation of mapreduce projects but I don t think I fully understand the program and it s capabilities with massive datasets 
4F71D7	1	positive	 When I first saw my homework I thought there are only problems and it should be some kind of easy However when I started to write it the problem came out   The first problem in the homework one does not have a exactly correct answer so I discussed a lot with my partner and for half an hour we finally came to the result We did the same step with problem and problem   I think the problems are a little bit difficult but when I finally finished it I realized that I get much more familiar with these concepts I think this is the only but big good thing  
4F8637	1	positive	 This is the first homework for CSE class Overall speaking the completion process was okay and I didn t spend too much time on this one through split into two days for completion For problem which is primarily an extension of lecture slides I completed that problem smoothly and quickly Problem was a little bit tricky so I had to go over it again and again Problem was like a piece of something and needed you to actually read every word of that article and try to understand the deeper meaning and reference of each term Completing problem was a bit of annoying Yet in the end I got three problems done before Wednesday which was even better than I thought 
5006EA	5	positive	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
500D51	9	positive	  rtf ansi ansicpg cocoartf cocoasubrtf  fonttbl f fswiss fcharset Helvetica   colortbl red green blue   expandedcolortbl   margl margr vieww viewh viewkind  pard tx tx tx tx tx tx tx tx tx tx tx tx pardirnatural partightenfactor   f fs cf HW Review  It is a good example of the combination of lab and homework assignment since the required input data are coming from the lab result And having experiences on running pig and spark definitely enlarge our understanding of clustered data processing and differences between other methods of dealing with big data 
503AA8	5	negative	 I think this assignment just like the last one takes much longer time to finish than the previous two homeworks I hope there is more example pieces of code for us to follow for the future homeworks since this one is pretty trial and error for us I did get a lot of help from the TA session as well as the Piazza posts though 
50C20E	4	negative	 I had a very busy week so I wasn t able to turn the homework in on time It was a little frustrating to realize that I couldn t finish the homework as fast as I expected and we had to work until Sunday morning to finalize our results Next time we should definitely plan ahead and get started earlier 
51253F	3	positive	 I think this homework is quite helpful For Problem and although they are quite fundemental concepts they strengthen my understanding Although reading materials is quite painful and time consuming it helps a lot Problem is a coding problem I find it quite useful and interesting to do Although I am not good at writing Java the fiven Java files have already included package and class making it much easier to focus on algorithm In sum I have a postive attitude toward hw 
5198A3	5	positive	 This homework requires lots of time on coding and it is not easy to find an example so I feel very struggled about that Although it is quite helpful I still need to admit it takes too much time and effort My VM cracks down and I spent hours on restoring it Meanwhile there were bugs with the provided java and not easy to fix since it hides deeply I gain a lot yet suffered a lot I would say it is both positive and negative about this home work and I had rather say I feel a net positive about that 
523E00	4	positive	 Overall it was quite fun having a way to run mapreduce jobs locally It allows us to be able to run tests on our job easier Most of my trouble came from trying to understand how local mode is different than hadoop mode I had some problems with my mapper class for problem but then I remebered to switch my split regex from w to s split on spaces not on noncharacters 
52D9C9	1	positive	 Cloud computing is widely used in daily life which makes this course so important for people even have different background Since the assignment is the first task I ve got actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The first question is just like a review of what we have done in class other ones are enhancing basic understanding of the techniques Generally speaking I m happy with the assignment 
542CE7	5	positive	 Problem is mainly about using combiner Implementing combiner is similar to Reducer and I can even use reducer function directly The last two question of this problem show us how to use TARN Resource Manager Web UI to monitor our MapReduce task and use data to indicate how combiner works And the second problem helps me understand how distributed cache and partitioner works in HDFS 
5461F8	2	neutral	 This assignment was better than the first It built off of labs which was a little annoying because I had cleaned up after the labs thinking we wouldn t need the results Luckily the lab was relatively simple so it wasn t a big deal to rerun the mapreduce program Overall a relatively easy homework assignment One thing though it is annoying to have to draw figures when we need to export as a pdf It is very time intensive In the future I would recommend making the assignments text based or screenshots of the terminal 
56CA3F	4	negative	 In homework there is many coding Because I am not good at java it takes me a while to think of it For the Question one it confuses me the length of a character Secondly I learn how to complete a tool runner and how to determine the type of map and reduce 
574AE6	9	positive	 This is a very good homework assignment It mainly focuses on Pig and Spark programs which are very good practices for students to get familiar with them The first three problems are based on Pig data analysis and manipulation Pig Latin is a language very similar with SQL These problems are not complicated but good enough to make students more familiar with the functionality and basic programming concepts of Pig The last two questions focus on Spark which is more powerful and comprehensive Overall all the five problems are valuable practices 
5893A5	1	positive	 This homework was too bad some of the problems were somewhat ambiguous in what they were asking but i just put in assumptions i made in the solution The second problem in addition was a little confusing but was a good use of bonferronis principle to understand how possible cases are seen 
5AC43E	5	neutral	 This homework is about combiner and partitioner The concept of combiner is fairly easy I am able to solve the problem easily The slides of partitioner are somewhat ambiguous and I was struggle about that part Especially when specifying the second cache file referring to home directory the command could not recognize the file path I guess there are some conflicts in the naming rule of Hadoop or linux system 
5B8F87	2	positive	 We struggled during this homework because it is not a very pleasant work Some of the words in the homework appear to be vague so I went to the office hour seeking for assistence Luckily the teacher assistent taught me a lot about how to finish this homework and that helped a lot I m writing this review because I need to write it and it should be longer than words Great job  Wilson That should be about fifty words now 
5C7959	3	negative	 Compared to previous homework this focus more on testing our understanding and implement ability It is not an easy homework  I need to review all slides and labs before I can write the answers Some concepts is quite confusing and I omitted them on class  This homework gives me a good chance to learn more knowledge which I thought is less important And this is the first programming  assignment My partner and I finished it successfully I hope the following programming will not be too hard 
5F24FA	8	positive	 This homework asked us to implement a mapreduce job from scratch in problem a of the first problem It requires tons of works but after that all the following problems are much easier Personally I enjoyed the problems like problem a and it also helped me practice basic java programming I think it s a good idea for homework to include both practical part and theoretic part 
617AFA	3	positive	 The first two problems are mean to let us understand how the job execution of MapReduce works but I personally think the questions were a little bit confusing For example in the first problem the significance of skewness can be ambiguous in some cases The problem is a good practice and introduction to hand on experience of MapReduce 
61C5FE	6	positive	 For this homework I have learned how to implement the MapReduce algorithms the custom WritableComparable and the inverted index I have a deep understand about how does the MapReduce work and how to debug efficiently during this homework I got a lot of bugs in my code my partner and I have paied a lot of effort on finding the bugs and slove it Finally we made it Thank you for the instructor and all the TAs help Thank you so much 
641165	4	negative	 This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug 
652EAD	5	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to use the use of combiner and partitioner in mapreduce jobs which can orgnise the result of mapper to save memory or call several reducers And I also got more familiar to the design and implement of the combiner and partitioner and their working theory 
665F25	2	positive	 All the problems are easy and fundamental They all tend to help to consolidate the knowledge of the HDFS map reduce structure Problem is easy but seems with no realistic meaning Problem only takes some easy manipulation if you have followed Lab instruction The whole homework is easy and straightforward and needs not much time to review 
68DA6C	6	positive	 In this lab we did a lot of work and spent a lot of time Really time comsuming job First we studied about how to implement a Writable project that is exactly like a Writable object but we got to define how it looks like to people and how that would work Second we studied about sequence files and compressed file Last but not least we also did a little in inverted mappers 
6A468A	3	positive	 This homework set is worthy Problem helps me do some digging on how functions are assigned and processed in HDFS My understanding for this process is more through The second problem is about YARN It also help me review the slides and data locality The problem coding part is thrilling although is not hard But it helps a lot on hadoop commands and how Mapper and Reducer are connected 
6AB792	4	positive	 In this homework set problem is mainly about using ToolRunner to test the program we write This part helps me understand how to implement ToolRunner and modify Mappper to work on different parameters cseSensitive in this problem And basiclly the implement part in problem is similar as other This problem is mainly about test and run the MapReducer project locally via command line or eclipse 
6C08DB	6	positive	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
6C5EAC	2	positive	 After finishing the homework I have a deeper understanding how HDFS separate the file and make sure each file have replication file in case that one rack doesn t work In the same time I have a fully awareness how to map and reduce the data and meanings of keys and values 
6CDC1A	3	positive	 I thought this homework was extremely useful for ensuring that I understand how Hadoop MapReduce works The second question requires a review of a lot of material and then to concisely summarize it The third question was a great start to writing our own MapReduce programs working with something very similar to our example programs 
6CEF0F	3	negative	 I have to say homework is much harder than the two previous homework assignments The first two questions ask us to understand the concepts related to skew in time and job excution of hadoop system using a service called YARN It just took me so much time trying to understand the difference between Hadoop and Hadoop with YARN The lecture could have been clearer in illustrating this concepts 
6D00D6	6	negative	 This homework is the toughest homework assignment ever since It not only requires participation and fully understanding in class also demands ability in solving problems that have not been taught Problem part a and part c s output file are hard to be read especially the third part So I considered them as something wrong with my code After I debuged for hours I then found out that they are supposed to be like that How frustrated am I 
6D6084	5	positive	 This homework has questions not that hard so we finished our parts half day each Especially the first question I have taken the course on this so it was easy for us to finish It was like only an hour to finished the first one and the second one was a little bit different so we spent a little more time to do this We are doing to submit the homework and I hope that we can get a good result 
6DAF06	3	negative	 In this homework we reviewed about the concept related to mapReduce The professor pointed out some vague concept which we need to understand Then we studied about the methods we need to know to write the lab I modified the wordCount program in order to get my own code It feels great to do some kind of coding actual practice than learning only about concept 
6DF2E5	5	positive	 This assignment was a good review for implementing what we learned in lecture Although I liked the assignment in general however many parts seemed to be not intuitive The test java file came with some errors and I had to chenge small bits of code to complete the assignment Also with the amount of imports I had to add I was unsure if I was completing the assignment correctly 
6E6AB0	7	positive	 In this homework I feel like there are a lot of math problems Although the concepts and calculations could really help us understand what actually happens behind the scene of a mapreduce job I think throwing in an actual implementation of the matrix multiplication would help us even more However overall I m pretty satisfied with the homework in terms of difficulty or workload I m also glad that we do not get homework for the future two weeks 
6F549B	8	positive	 I found this homework assignment to be fun and challenging It was exciting that we got to use actual Netflix data in order to see real applications of mapreduce and how it is used It was a bit difficult to write the MR program entirely from scratch which we haven t had to do in previous hw assignments but by this time I am pretty familiar with the format I liked that we had to find the average rating per user in whichever language we choose It is exciting to be learning how to do all of this As usual I had a hard time with the conceptual questions It also took me a while to figure out how to compute the cosine similarity MR inputs outputs in a collaborative filtering approach 
6F9FFA	4	positive	 This was an interesting hw Some of the instructions on question were confusing and I wasn t sure what was being asked at all points I think I learned a lot about writing a full mapreduce program and test program for my map and reduce programs as well as implementing toolrunner I m excited to see what comes next and what more you can apply mapreduce on 
6FB461	2	positive	 I really enjoyed this homework I felt that the problems were extremely relevant and actually worked towards useful skills and knowledge The only real hiccup was finding information on how the clusters of Hadoop are set up so that I could check my work The slides for this area did not have much of the process 
6FBF5C	4	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to use the job configruation to adjust parmater locally with commend line and running the programs locally with commendline by applying toolrunner and with eclipse And I also got more familiar to the design of mapreducer and its working theory 
718BD6	9	negative	 This homework is much more complicated than past homework I think this homework should be given more instructions For instance for the first questions we don t know if we are doing it correctly after doing it I think this can be improved by following instructions If it gives me the right output for the test input we know that we are doing it with right code on the right dataset But now I feel very unsafe after doing this because I don t know which may go wrong For the problems and they are pretty straightforward 
72C56F	3	positive	 from this homework I have a basic understanding of how to use java to implement the MapReduce Because of the coding process I went through the whole progress of the map function and reduce function Meanwhile I also got a clear insight towards the structure of the MapReduce process such as where should the different data be stored how many processes are there in different phases I have learned a lot from this homework Thank you so much for the instructor and all the TAs help 
739DDF	8	negative	 This hw was okay except for question b I really did not understand how to do that and was extrememly confused as to how to compute the cosine similarity given the reducer input This was fairly stressfull and took almost as long as all of question and the beginning of I am excited that we are almost done with these homeworks as they cause a lot of stress in my week 
7452E0	3	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got a better understanding about how the map reduce algorithm works in java and I wrote the program of it on my own which is very helpful for me to learn the program better 
745493	7	positive	 This homework was a bit challenging but fair I was able to apply some of the concepts i learned in class to real problems thats not does not require me to write code The coding portion of this homework allowed freedom of development as long as the problem is solved This homework did not take long compared to homework in the past and my stress level was pretty low 
747DDD	9	positive	 hi thank for the homework Yo what should I write Equain was the guy who happens to be on a blackboard in a washu building And I also got distracted by Pingpong tables when I do the homework Genereally this would help us coding Yep pretty useful Yea very useful Yea extremely useful I like this homework It s so good soo good And I learnt a lot from here How do you bullshit But bullshit is a bad work so I will type a good word here such as good 
75C4FB	7	positive	 For this homework I have a lot of practice on the matrix compution which gives me a deeper understanding of the matrix inner product and outter product Also by think about the difference between the two different representation of the transition matrix I developed my logic of trading off between the memory and efficiency Thank you for the instructor and all the TAs help Thank you so much 
75D295	1	positive	  When I do Q it reminds me of the knowledge in the class However I feel uncertainty of every choice I think Q is reasonable I can get the probability through the calculation of the amount of combination and probability to choose one situation Finally when I am doing the last question I am also not so sure whether I understand the meaning correctly or not 
765856	2	positive	 This homework is a good review for the labs and the contents in the lectures It reminds me again how HDFS stores data and how data are achieved by clients Also it gives me more practices about command operations in Linux environment and brings me a deeper understanding about how MapReduce works 
766D5F	1	negative	 I thought the homework was easy overall but I did have trouble when it came to deciding whether a dataset had complexity or not for the first part of the homework I also struggled a bit to come up with the equation for the second part of the homework since probability is my weak point The third part of the homework had questions that were pretty vague and I wasn t sure what kind of answer was required of me but I was probably just overthinking it 
770D3A	6	positive	 This homework was a challenge It tested everything we went over in lecture but since we didn t have a lab on the material it took me a while to implement some of the code I feel like I gained a better understanding of how compression noncompression works after doing this assignment Overall I enjoyed this assignment and was am very comfortable with the command line to run test on hfds while also debugging any errors that may come 
775722	4	positive	 I liked this assignment because it yet again allowed us to test and implement an actual map reduce job The process also reflected that of a reasonable job implementation flow starting from testing locally eventually to submitting the actual job on the hdfs Otherwise I enjoyed the questions regarding the undersatanding of which methods are easier to run jobs locally as well as why and how the records are sorted 
77DEA5	8	positive	 Problem is about implementing Top N List for recommend system and it helps me understand how to implement multiply MapReduce job in a single driver In this problem I use lots of knowledge learned before like distributed cache For part b of this problem the result from R gets me a hint that dealing with SQL data it is better and more efficient to preprocess the data first Problem is more theoretic it let me think about the difference and similarity between different similarity measurements For the last problem it compares item item approach with user user approach 
7816CE	9	positive	 It is great that this is the last homework I feel relieved The Pig questions were not hard if you completed the lab and they were also more fun than Java MapReduce I hope we could complete the makeup homework and the final project on time to leave this course with no regret 
78D8A6	9	positive	 Homework provides many hands on practices on Hive Spark as well as Python and Scala After finished this homework I obtained many knowledge on how to extract the information we want from some raw dataset by Pig And I also understand how spark uses RDD to manipulate the data They all very helpful Hope I can have more opportunities on finding job by learning them 
79F9F0	7	negative	 This time s homework is a little bit difficult And since it is our mid term week i have to spend a lot of time of reviewing for the exam So so sad for that So tired for busy doing a lot of things in a short time I felt depressed But fortunately It is over The spring break comes Happy Spring break 
7AA72D	9	positive	 HW is very helpful for PIG and SPARK But I am trapped by some application of running spark on YARN and viewing stages and tasks and it takes too long a time Other part seems not too hard but still requires lots of understanding and codes writing In total I feel positive for this homework and it is a little bit too easy for this PIG and SPARK part of course 
7ADD2D	5	negative	 In this homework I make a mistake I forget to turn capital character into lower case So I can t divide some of the word from shakespeare poems After all anything that build this combiner helps me to use combiner with tool runner and run it in the local place Anyway it is helpful to some extent 
7C01B3	5	positive	 This week s homework is about the combiner and the partitioner These concepts are important to the map reduce because it largely decreases the time of processing input and output This week was really busy I spent a lot of time on my homework and reviewing knowledge learnt from last weeks But i think i got a lot I am happy to see that i successful finished all the due before due time 
7D011A	7	negative	 This homework is a bit weired The first question is too easy and I dont get lots of practice with relative skills And the requirement is not clear For example whether the word appears in next line should be counted as a cop word for the last word in the previous line How should we count one word line And other questions like matrix computation should all be taken as coding work but not just easily hand writing and sedo code work By codinng work I usualy be able to understand the skill much better 
7D2934	9	negative	 This homework was mostly busy work It was not very clear on how we should compile scala files It would have been better to have more practice or examples of running a scala file The pig part of the homework was rather easy I was a little confused on how the driver works 
7D7DF3	1	positive	 For the homework I think I have gained a basic understanding of the big data s properties I m so excited to get started to learn about the big data and the clould computing Meanwhile the paper gave me a new perspective towards the big data I think I learned a lot from this homework This homework is very useful for me to form a new approach to deal with data Thank you so much for this assignment 
7FFC5D	2	positive	 The hw is ok it covers most of the knowledge and technique from the previous lectures and labs But it is a bit too theoretical It requires a bit more practice with linux system Some quetions are open answer and hard to response Some questions are not highlighted in lectures or lab and easy to be ignored It requires some time to go back to lecture or lab notes 
82423C	2	positive	 In homework I tried some commands about MapReduce in VM and get some sample results I am quiet happy that we have already began to do real practice in cluster computing and big data This homework help us to learn more detail about the procedure of MapReduce and I cannot wait for writing my own MapReduce program 
825284	7	positive	 This homework is hard It took me and my partner a lot of energy and time to figure out everything However it is really excited and a good sport I feel that I understand the structure of MapReduce and how the driver mapper and reducer toolrunner work much better Also the command line starts to become my new best friend I start to in love with Linux 
82EA56	8	neutral	  This homework assignment is good but a little confusing The first question is programming assignment and it requires the students to build a whole MapReduce program from the beginning which is really nice The second question is related to some comparisons and requires deeper understanding of methods in collaborative filtering The third question is mainly based on mapper and reducer inputs and outputs which will be more comprehensive One problem is the equation of cosine similarity on the slides is slightly different from the equation from the textbook MMDS and Wikipedia which will lead to some confusion Further explanation and clarification might be needed for cosine similarity in order to prevent misunderstanding of the students 
83A2AA	3	positive	 This homework is a good exercise to get familiar with coding map and reduce functions in Java for use in Hadoop It is helpful in that it helps us better understand the different kind of daemons and processes involved in resource management in Hadoop and also the basic workflow of each mapreduce job 
83ED13	2	neutral	 I feel hw is much harder than hw but the thing I like about this homework is that it pushed me to really dig into the conceptual structure of the HDFS I find the most difficult problem is the question of problem I am still not so sure about the relationship between nodes and blocks 
847854	7	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got more familiar to the use of pairs and stripes in during with the mapreduce job with keys that are combined and also the calculation of the pagerank 
853098	8	negative	 This homework was difficult It was longer than most of the other homeworks and was more open ended This was the first time I wish I had worked with a partner Especially writing code to analyze the average user rating data and visualize it Although it was nice that we were given starter code it almost would have been easier to write my own solution instead of debugging what I broke in the given implementation 
861BE1	7	positive	 This homework is about mapreduce applications The matrix vector multiplication interests me most It relates to my research directly However there is no real implementation about it in this homework Hopefully I can have a chance to practice it in the future homework or project Writing the input output of mapper and reducer is still helpful 
868D1E	2	positive	 The second homework is mainly about the map reduce  The first problem is easy but it took some time to fully understand every question since some of them are unclear to me  The second and third problem are about the concept of map reduce which seem to be quite easy for us as long as we know about it  The last problem is about running a MapReduce job on VM and it did take some time to be done  Every question for this homework is not complex to me 
86A4EF	6	neutral	 This homework felt very disjointed I don t feel that I got a good understanding of any of the particular concepts covered in this homework but more just touched on th very basics of different topics It was also strange how some of the parts required output from the Hadoop jobs while others did not 
87DFCA	2	positive	 By this assignment I understand how the mapper and reducer work how to imporve the speed and efficency of the Mapreduce It turn out to be very useful for us to think about inforamtion in the big data way Also I have learned about HDFS which is a brilliant idea to deal with tons of data It gives the machines the ability to process the data faster 
882769	1	negative	 I had a lot of trouble with problem I never did quite figure out how to get the last row of the hint table It would have been nice to have some better explanation on h ow to do this problem For problem it would be nice to have a more through explanation on the dimensions The slides and the lecture helped but it wasn t enough maybe an example of data sets that have or don t have a certain dimension 
88607D	8	positive	 This homework is easier compared to the last one and some answers are directly from slides I feel good about this homework  I spent too much time on the TopN mapreduce The reason is first I have some new ideas about sorting the list but after trying several times I realize that it will add too much  communication cost So eventually I decided to give it up Another reason is that I get a crash on VBox and fail to restart it It took me too long a time to retrieve the data and  rewrite my previous codes That is quite annoying But for the homework itself it is quite easy and direct I like this style and have a very positve attitude towards it I learn a lot from it and it strengthens my understanding towards top N list even from pain I hope we could hold this style in the future 
887980	5	negative	 This homework was incredibly poorly written and extraordinarily difficult to complete  We did not receive the guidance necessary to complete this and some of the code that was given from the slides had been deprecated or did not work This should not be the case as I would expect my classes to have up to date information Overall this homework made me angry and stressed 
896D17	8	positive	 It is a quite complicated homework this time and I actually did most of it during my trip in Chicago It requires a thorough knowledge of mapreduce from top to bottom and doing a mapreduce job from to is quite interesting though Anyway it is a good review of the final exam for the part in mapreduce 
8A07D3	8	negative	 This homework was extremely frustrating I was very unsure of how to approach the mapreduce program and I thought that a lot of what we spent time on was really dumb debugging stuff and not really on the code Also I was pretty unsure about the Item Item Similarity mapreduce program for problem To be honest I ve been pretty frustrated with my partner and the fact that he didn t turn in the homework assignments I asked him to turn in Pretty unfortunate to be honest I really hope my grade doesn t suck because of him Kinda stupid cuz no one actually reads this tho 
8A9763	2	positive	 I was happy with how relevant this homeowrk was to the lectures and lab slides it helped me understand the specific output of the job and interpret the results as well Although the relationship between nodes and racks was not clear in the slides the solution was very intuitive and matches the diagrams as described in lecture Although some of the questions seemed a vague I thought it was adequate to test understanding of the material and how well we followed the labs 
8BB9E6	5	positive	 This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug This homework is too hard since it requires a lot of coding skills and it is very hard to debug 
8C7C43	9	positive	 This homework helps me review the lecture contents about Spark and Pig which are important data analysis tool I learn a lot about the operations of pig and Spark through this homework Also I get a deeper understanding about how the Pig and Spark works Homework is a good combination of practice and class knowledge 
8CA73C	1	neutral	 Overall I would say that I enjoyed this homework assignment It is often difficult for me to describe data in words so the first question was challenging but helpful I had fun figuring out the second question and thinking about how to model the probability of a false accusation I didn t love the third problem because reading and analyzing articles is difficult for me hence why I m an engineer but similar to the first problem it was a useful exercise 
8DDF2D	8	negative	 I had a lot of trouble with this assignment I was mainly in charge of problem but even that problem was confusing It was hard to keep track of all the stats that the mapper and reducers will output or combine This will be the first time I worked with a partner for this assignment Hopefully by having a partner this assignment will be easier to do 
8E099F	4	negative	 This homework took much longer than the other homeworks There was a lot of setup involved and it required looking back at previous labs and homeworks Looking back at previous assignments is a pain especially if you don t remember exactly which lab the information can be found in In the future it would be helpful to have more info directly in the hw reminders and hints for example Overall I d say the length was the biggest detriment to the homework 
906C77	1	positive	 Everything about this homework was positive I believe it was a great introduction to cloud computing and taught us the basics needed to be successful in the course The problems were fair and related to material covered in lecture in the previous week The problems were average in difficulty and required a little outside reading to fully grasp the concepts of the problems This was a great first impression and I look forward to the future assisnments 
945100	1	negative	 In this very first homework we are doing something quite introductive rather than a real work or project in cloud computing or data In addition most of the questions are subjective which means there are no specifically correct answer for each of the question and this makes me a bit of difficult to write up answers But in total I have to say this is not a hard one 
945D23	7	negative	 This homework is highly unclear in several sub questions For example problem c is too wide to answer I have to write a lot to make sure I expressed my ideas clearly problem d did not mention the O notation in the textbook at all So as I have mentioned in the questionaire in thursday s course questions in quizzes and homeworks are too opaque 
94EF53	6	positive	 This homework is generally good though it is a little bit confusing in terms of instructions and wording It contains contents about mapreduce JAVA file compression using Snappy codec custom writablecomparable and inverted index To me the inverted index seems to be the most useful part and the instructions are stated the most clearly 
978018	8	negative	 We have a hard time doing this homework In problem we do not know how to translate ids into titles and it costed a lot of time for us to figure it out Besides when we work on problem one we have not learned pig or hive so we need to look for tutorials And for problem three the computation is in a different way compared with what in PPT so it is hard for us to get the correct answer without an example 
97C9FF	9	neutral	 I feel very split on this homework I love working in Pig but I really don t like Spark Pig seems to come pretty naturally I liked the lab and think it is a useful tool to know especially because it also works for local processing of smaller datasets Spark on the other hand just seems really cumbersome to me and hard to test Maybe it s that I don t get functional programming yet but I was really frustrated by the Spark problems 
97F531	9	negative	 I have to say this homework is a mess Cuz it is totally spread out in different content skils and even the file and data we have to use a spread in different folder By which I had a tough time to find them all And it requires to finish the lab The data from the lab is also in a different folder It is even tougher since I spend time on midterm and when I came back to work on this hw I found I have to go through all thsoe thigs to find the file and folder 
98640E	7	positive	 For this problem set the first problem is about using pair as key So it only needs a small change that we can make the old version MapReduce work on this problem In the second problem helps a lot on understanding how to implement MapReduce to do matrix vector multiplication and the difference between strips and pairs For the last problem it helps to understand the time and space complexity for PageRank 
9BB028	2	positive	 In my opinion homework is pretty straightforward The problem is close to what we are studying in class As long as we did the lab we can finish problem and problem easily Problem and problem are basic of MapReduce system so as long as we attend the lecture we will be able to do it easily In conclusion I think this homework is really helpful and straightforward 
9BF133	2	positive	 I think this homework is more straight forward than the first homework Partly because there are a lot less open ended questions in the second homework and partly because the problems are more specific in details and give out examples to illustrate what it is really asking for I m happy about how the homework turned out and will sure look forward to more homework like this in the future 
9C2304	4	negative	 Today i just finished the homework It was a pretty good homework for me I enjoyed creating a new map reduce project through the entire process of development That was pretty chill I hope we have more homework like this as it help me to progress as a student and a scholar 
9CA661	5	positive	 Homework is a good way for us to have a comprehensive understanding of the debug methods and the fully utilization of hadoop By completing the homework I integrated my knowledge about hadoop system And also the difficulty of this task is at the right level such that we need to think about it and it covers what we ve learnt And the there s no ambiguousness in this homework So I think I will prefer this homework to the other ones 
9CC279	2	negative	  thought this homework was certainly more difficult than the previous one where we were mainly familiarizing ourselves with basic concepts With this homework we sure did a couple of exercises on concepts such as problem but they were harder to comprehend than homework and both my partner and I had to constantly refer to lecture slides and notes to complete the problem  
9DB7D5	6	positive	 Homework is slightly longer and more challenging than the previous ones but that also makes it more exciting and rewarding when you figure out how to do it It is a good exercise in writing custom writables and comparables reading and writing compressed and uncompressed sequence file and implementing an inverted indexer Overall it was a very helpful exercise 
9EFB15	9	positive	 In this homework we are using pig and spark to analyze data Since these tools are higher level than MapReduce and have interactive shell as well as higher abstraction I find they are more convenient than MapReduce when analyzing data But I am not very familiar with Python so I need more time to study how to write a spark program However it is worth to learning a useful and powerful tool 
9F5293	3	positive	 This time s homework is about writing the MapReduce Java code to do the Map and Reduce function I implemented The driver class Mapper class and the reducer class Then i tested the result by using the input and output of our example to see whether it is corrected  Finally i got the corrected answer Hahaha That s all for this 
9FBCC5	7	positive	 I thought that this homework was in some ways more challenging because we had to conceptually model how we would implement our map reduce program for stripes However it was also nice not to have to waste time debugging as much code and just make sure that we understood the concepts The book problems were also nice to solidify our learning for several concepts that we didn t really touch on much in class Overall a pretty nice homework 
A087A2	2	positive	 This homework is well structured it tests if I understood what I was doing in Lab and Lab where Lab was about distributed file storage system and Lab was about MapReduce Problem again assigns some reading in part c which I don t like that much and it turned out that it doesn t have much to do with what I need to know before answering that question 
A27FEA	6	negative	 This homework is relatively too much and hard compared to previous one Each question has too many sub questions And some of them are not coverd in the lecture and we have to figure it out by ourselves which is fine for couple questions but did take time some of them actually can be easily treated wrongly and will take for ever to solve and debug I think hw should be easier and straightforward as a semi system class 
A414EF	4	negative	 This hw is totally destroying me I am good with the job implemention although there is still some ambiguity with codes I can deal with it after tryingn several times It is very time consuming but not bad What drives me mad is the numerous tiny questions which I could hardly understand Every small part has more than one questions and for several of them I cannot imagine how to answer it Print statements in local and hadoop mode Have we ever covered that point in class What should we bear in mind Well there is literally no standard answer for such questions In a word this hw makes me annoyed frustrated and depressed My attitude towrds it is Strongly Negtive 
A41C55	1	neutral	 The first homework is kind of an introduction to big data and its application To complete this homework I spent some times on reading the assigned materials which are a little time consuming although the homework itself is not hard than I imagine My favorite question in this this homework is the second question because it provides an interesting background behind the math which makes me feeling how close big data is to our life 
A453B2	1	positive	 well it is really interesting to do this experiment  For this homework one since this is our first written homework in this semester i thought it may not be difficult Actually it is easy as i expected So i m glad to see that  But with the time goes by i believe the difficulty will become higher and i have already been ready for that Just come on   Hanming Li 
A4FDF3	4	neutral	 This is a very good homework assignment The first problem is related to implementation of ToolRunner and passing the parameter to the MapReduce program to control the behavior of the program The second problem is more challenging with comprehensive questions and programming practices Student need to know the whole running process the input intermediate and output data as well as the difference between running on cluster and testing locally in order to answer all questions Some of the questions are a little ambiguous in meaning but they can still be answered with detailed explanations 
A5D7BF	7	negative	 This homework was more concept heavy than the previous homeworks have been so I didn t like it as much as the previous homeworks It definitely helped reinforce the PageRank material and I appreciated that since we breezed through it in lecture But I also had to get a lot of help from MMDS 
A604A9	4	positive	 This homework is like a review for past labs and homework We are supposed to review the lab instructions and homework solutions if we are not very proficient in dooing things with command line The implementation part is like a immitation part because all we are supposed to do have been done in class Code can be found on slides and lab instructions but still it is good to have some hands on experience with real jobs This homework took me hours and I think it helped me to learn something 
A6744A	7	positive	  This week s homework is much easier and clearer than last week s one For last week my teammate and I spent more than ten hours to finish it and question two is extremely hard This is week s material is the application of matrix in mapreduce and data mining which makes great sense to me 
A811BC	4	neutral	 I had some other things to do last week so I began to start this homework really late It took me some time to figure out what s going on in the slides and I had to revised my lab submission The homework itself was not really hard but it took more time than I expected to finish the homework And I did play around with hadoop fs and learned some new comments as well 
A87095	7	positive	 In homework number seven we did some matrix multiplication The homework is actually really helpful for me to get to know all the stuff I need to know in class Moreover it explains about how to use proper techniques that utilize the matrix multiplication which includes taxation and other stuff I like to do this homework because I may or may not benefit from doing it The coding part of this homework is easy so this homework is like more conceptual 
A89319	1	positive	 Homework Review  Zheng Yuan    For this homework I think the first two problems are very helpful for us to understand some basic concepts For example in Problem we can have a more clearly understanding on the properties of big data And in problem by computing the formula we can get a more concluded idea of Bonferroni s Principle and the factor that effects the false accusations As for the third problem I think it is a good way for us to know a little about the differences between unlabeled and labeled data data based approach 
A9CEC2	4	positive	 Thank you so much for assigning this homework I think I have learned a lot from this assignment Through this homework I learned how to use toolbar to run java files how to use the unit test to make sure the code I have writtren is right Also I have a deeper understanding of what s going on with the MapReduce I m appreciated for this homework 
AAE709	7	neutral	 This homework is less challenging than homework It took us more than hours to finish the homework and we think it is not too difficult The code is running very slow on problem Our MR is also running so slow on our laptop so we are quite frustrated when doing this homework Problem and Problem is straightforward and very helpful in a way that it helps us understand the concept of matrix multiplication mapreduce better 
AD7289	5	positive	 It is good to understand the importance of combiner and how to use it by problem And it will be a nice to practice an example when the use of combiner is inevitable  The problem is an exercise for partitioner which makes the process of MapReduce more practical for the real life situations 
ADAAA4	1	positive	 This homework is rather easy in term of negative or positive I feel positive about this homework The part of properties of different datasets is useful to make sure I understand Concepts like amount size infinity etc I hope I didn t write too much for problem Problem two is too similar to what is written in the book and I got a clear understanding of how large volume data would give us wrong outcomes through analysis because huge number of data makes more random events This taught a valuable lesson before learning data mining and big data because trusting data too much may be fooled by data itself 
ADBCEF	9	positive	 This is the last homework of the whole semester This semster went quite fast yet I did learn much more things than I exepcted In terms of the Spark part of this assignment I googled almost every command since I am not familiar with either Spark or Python That was painful and debugging was painful too But it worked in the end 
AE1A8E	9	neutral	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
AF2949	9	positive	 Homework is very good and helpful in helping us practice with the various analysis tools such as Pig Hive and Spark It is a little long but very rewarding once you get it done By doing homework I also got to understand more the different advantages and disadvantages of using each tool 
AF76FC	6	negative	 I had a lot of trouble with problem Most of my errors were from typos in my coding For example I would have code that is value get but the for loop was String line lines These types of errors made me waste alot of time figuring out what went wrong For problem I had some confusion on which direction or I should have for my compareTo method 
AF8F47	7	neutral	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
AF8F4E	3	positive	 Zheng Yuan   Considering problem I think this homework is very helpful for us to get familiar with how to write your own MapReduce task instead of understanding the concept of the MapReduce only As for the first problem and it gives us a chance to recognize the challenge and the bottleneck of the Hadoop MapReduce job execution which are also good questions 
AFAF7F	3	positive	 This homework is a good combination of theoretical knowledge and practice The first two questions are nice reviews for the lecture content which gives me a better understanding about the work procedure of MapReduce Tasks and the data storage in the processing The last question gives a good chance to practice how to build a MapReduce model 
B0A126	2	neutral	 Cloud computing is widely used in daily life which makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing Like Hadoop HDFS map reduce and so on I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
B1BA1F	4	positive	 I definitely found this homework to be more challenging and time consuming but also more satisfying and interesting There were some aggravating debugging moments but overall I think it was very good for me to learn by doing and it definitely helped me get a better grasp of the content Running tasks locally is awesome and so fast 
B302EA	1	positive	 I feel generally good about this homework I spent approximately hours to complete this homework Problem helped me review the data properties discussed in class Problem is very interesting and I think it is trying to tell me something worthnoting but unrelated to this course itself I feel happy after I verified my formula with the provided table I also don t see a connection between problem and course material 
B32CEF	2	positive	 This assignment basically let us review the materials from lab and lab and the concept of MapReduce I think it is helpful since I did not get a clear idea of how distributed file system works in class but after this assignment I got better understanding of it MapReduce is a complex process to implement and I think what is covered in this homework about MapReduce is a good introduction for us to learn and do the following assignment 
B5121C	5	neutral	 In this homework we studied how to implement combiner and partitioner to MapReduce program At first I am a little bit confused about distributed cache but after checking relative parts in the course slide I remember how it works and finally finished it But since I am not very familiar with java I find the code work become more difficult for compared with previous homework However more difficulties mean that I can learn more from the homework 
B5DAC7	1	neutral	 Homework mainly focuses on the basic concepts of big data which is reasonable This homework makes student better understand the concepts introduced in classes and also more exercises apart from class quizzes are presented However there are still some questions which are related to too much explanations which may harm the enthusiasm of some students for this class In sum this is a good homework assignment and I personally look forward to more practices in programming and data analysis 
B69A4D	6	positive	 This is the th homework so far I did the first and the second problems Not easy for me I looked up on website and referred some books then finally I have done the job Quite confident of this I hope that every next homework will be handful and the exam will not be that hard I turned the homework not that early so the th homework has already out I hope it would not hard for me 
B6D6C9	3	positive	 This homework was fairly satisfying After getting help to understand what skew is I feel like I actually understand the concept Problem was helpful to review how job execution works though I am perhaps still a little confused on some of the details Problem was actually really fun because we finally got to apply what we have learned to write an actual very simple program It also sorted out some confusion I had on navigating the local file system vs Hadoop in terminal so that was helpful It finally feels like we have the building blocks needed to accomplish things with MapReduce 
B78272	6	negative	 This hw had two nice questions and an extremely difficult one I was not prepared for question and I expect to have lost the majority of my points because of questiI I don t think I had a good idea of what was going on I hope the next hw is not like that 
B7EDC5	2	neutral	 This week s homework was way harder than I expected I still felt the class was interesting and the lab was okay It was practical but not too hard However the recap quiz is really hard and I even did not have time to finish all of the questions which may some how indicated that I was familiar with all the material from the class Therefore it is clear that I might also struggle with the homework However I think it is a good way to check myself and to motivate myself to catch up with the class 
B89669	2	positive	 Homework is also pretty helpful in consolidating my understanding of how a large file is stored in HDFS and what the mapper and reducer do and what their inputs and outputs are A minor complaint that I have is that some questions could have been worded better or provided more context or instructions for example d 
B9F0B6	7	positive	 This one took me longer than last one The question about what the flaws of word co method confused me Do you want to know about what each part of the data stands for Or do you want to know what type of data is actually in the data file This is actually the fuzzy part The programming and debugging required by this homework is fine which means that it is not as challenging as the last homework I think this homework is theoretical and fun 
BA6FA2	5	positive	 For the hw I have implement how to use combiner and partationer to make the MapReduce faster and can save memory By comparing the outputs of the MapReduce using combiner and the MapReduce without using combiner I find out that the combiner can save memory in process the Mapper so if we wan to procsee tons of data it is very important for us to use the combiner to save memory and make our processing faster 
BB24BD	9	positive	 The first problem helps me get familiar with UNIX commands and implement pig script The second problem is similar with the first one and I only need to modify a small part of the code from last problem to do the job Problem let me find a mistake I make on lab when loading the data I should specify an alternate delimiter as an argument to PigStorage Problem and is about Spark They are also very helpful 
BB956E	4	positive	 I found this homework assignment quite enjoyable I prefer implementing classes and programs in Java to answering questions about an article textbook chapter This homework has been my favorite so far because it involved more than just following the directions I welcomed the challenge of passing a parameter to the AvgWordLength class that I wrote for last week s homework and writing a new MR program for the weblog file I didn t love the last few parts of problem because I was confused on what the questions were asking 
BBB7F2	6	negative	 The problem and are fairly easy and related contents are covered in the class However the content for problem is not fully covered in class Also the description of the problem is ambiguous I don t know whether I should combine the mapper output files or not expect for problema The sequence file is java only container I think the class should emphasis on more general things 
BCC57E	4	positive	  hw review Zheng Yuan    I think this homework is very helpful for us to get familiar with how to pass parameter to out mapper reducer and how to run the mapreduce job locally   Besides we also get the chance to write a test java file to test whether out mapreduce procedure is correct 
BD0482	1	positive	 The first homework corresponds to the basic concepts of big data These questions are related to the properties of different data set and the methods of processing them in the real world The hidden concepts are fundamental but useful Understanding their different properties leads to the motivation of data mining methods we should learn in the later classes 
BD81A3	7	negative	 This homework is more mathematical this time and I need to think for a long time to make sure I have done the right computation Matrix multiplication is very complex and it is still difficult for me to compute it without reference Maybe I still need to practice more time to get familiar with it 
BD8D50	8	neutral	 I like how this homework incorporated some formal proof and qualitative questions instead of coding problems only However I found it frustrating that the formula for cosine similarity given in class is not the same as the formula given on the wiki page for collaborative filtering the latter of which made much more sense It would have been great if the professor and the TAs could have helped us resolve this confusing issue on Piazza 
BDAFE5	8	positive	 I was responsible for the last problems so I will talk about the respond of finishing last problems It is not that quite straight forward but for problem instructor has talked about the similarity measurement and it asks about the normalized problem I have taken the courses that mentioned the normalized cosine similarity and Pearson correlation so it is quite easy for me to answer this problem Moreover for the problem it is quite different from what mentioned in class that it considered the difference between users this problem considers similarity between movies but the process is the same so it is easy too 
BEF119	1	negative	 In my own opinion this homework assignment is good for us to understand the basic concept of this course For the paper to read while working on problem I do think it s a good article but the description of the problem is somehow ambiguous which led to unneccessary time consuming so it would be perfect if the description can be revised 
BF1A0F	1	positive	 I thought this homework was a good overview of the reading and extra materials It provided a good synopsis of te slides as well and provided decent questions to test the understanding The question regarding probability seemed a bit irrelevant to the lectures but was relatively easy to grasp The summary questions for the article were a bit open ended but I liked that it allowed us to provide a broader response so that it could test my understanding 
C03C93	3	positive	 In my opinion homework is also pretty straightforward I and my partner took around  hours to finish the assignment I like the coding assignment problem the most among the three problems It is practical assignment and also help us deepen our understanding of the MapReduce process I hope there will be more problem in the next homework that will be similar to problem in this homework 
C07361	3	positive	 This is my third homework now for course cses and I am quite confident with it because there are three questions as long as I do it carefully I can finish it For the first question we have to understand what and how MapReduce job works exactly so if we totally understand it this problem will be easy Fir the second question we read the hadoop book to get the answer as well as google search for the answer and finally we get our own answer For the last question we just have to revise previous wordcount one to fit this one so actually not that hard  I hope this time I can get a good score 
C14926	6	positive	 This is a very good homework assignment The first problem is related to the custom WritableComparable which will lead to a better understanding to create and handle the user defined Writable types The second problem is complicated but valuable using SequenceFiles with and without compression to make students more familiar with different kinds of storage of data The third problem is inverted index a fairly comprehensive problem about designing Mapper and Reducer All problems are satisfactorily comprehensive 
C18F5E	1	positive	 This homework is not too difficult or easy Question is problem that we already done in class P quiz We have not seen or talk about things in problem and in class but it becomes straightforward if we read the text book I doesn t took me a lot of time to do this homework The style of question is different from the normal compsci homework style because we need to read and get the information from the article to answer the questions the problem doesn t have a lot of math involved 
C19BE4	8	negative	 This homework was tricky I spent like five to six hours on the first part of problem analyzing codes from GitHub and trying to setup enviroment generate mapreduce codes and test data And I spent like five hours trying to plot the distribution of average rating per user It was horrible I tried Pig Excel R Java and finally got my plot Don t understand the meaning of doing such great calculation from the raw data file The other parts were fine and easy compared to the first part Anyway two more homework left probably three 
C1D819	9	negative	 This homework was fucking terrible It was quite annoying and gave me a terrible terrible terrible feeling in my stomach On other words todays lunch is bauer was not too bad I had the barbecue chicken with green leafy broccoli That was delicious Guy fierier would deb very pleased with the service Peace love J 
C402CC	4	positive	 My teammate and I are both extremely busy this week Therefore we are not able to finish the homework on time and we are really grateful that we have an auto extension for each homework We both really enjoy this homework and we hope we can finish the homework on time for the rest of the homeworks 
C44937	6	negative	 This homework was incredibly unfair and extraordinarily frustrating The material needed to solve some of the questions was stuff that we had not or only very vaguely covered in class Other times the questions were so incredibly poorly written or vague that I was unsure what to do and was unsure if I solved the question that was even being asked I hope the homeworks become much more clear as they are making it very hard to even learn the material as I expected to 
C45709	7	negative	 I had a lot of trouble with problem it was quite confusing to figure out the inputs and outputs of part b The st problem was quite simple to implement I had no idea how to answer part c of problem I assumed we were to talk about how we would perform the preprocessing step 
C5A259	9	positive	 My task is to do problem to problem and I think after doing the lab it is quite easy to do with problem Actually I did not attend the course that introduce the Spark but I searched through google and carefully study the course slides I quickly figured out how to deal with the problem and got the result It is quite easy for me 
C684F9	8	positive	  Homework Review   Zheng Yuan   Program   Its a great opportunity to write a whole mapreduce program by ourself   Help us understand the how to analyse the distribution and cope with the enthusiastic and overly pessimistic raters   Program   Help us get a clear concept of difference between cosine similarity and Pearson correlation connection between normalized cosine similarity and thePearson correlation   Help us know the strong point and weakness of cosine similarity measure   Help us know the disadvantage of Jaccard similarity measure and the way to cope with it   Program   Help us understand the advantage of item item similarites measure   Help us understand the procedure of the mapreduce job of the item item similarites measure  
C6EF58	6	negative	 I thought this homework was certainly more difficult than the previous one where we were mainly familiarizing ourselves with basic concepts With this homework we sure did a couple of exercises on concepts such as problem but they were harder to comprehend because we ve never dealt with writing a java program in this class before and both my partner and I had to constantly refer to lecture slides and notes to complete the problem  
C72CEF	4	negative	 The ToolRunner portions of this homework were irritating Implementing ToolRunner is not difficult but I had numerous issues with ToolRunner not recognizing options or capturing my command line arguments as ToolRunner arguments The actual programming aspects of this homework were enjoyable though I m not sure how we re supposed to recognize the HTML logs without prior exposure 
C75361	8	negative	 Currently i am pretty stressed out with everything that is upcoming in my life I am currently looking for a job and have some interviews coming up It feels like the amount of work i need to do and prepare for is overwhelming I am really hoping i can get the ckm advisors job That would really be an icredible achievement for myself Please let me get it so i can chill Otherwis ei feel like my rest of the semester is going to suck eggs Which i feel like it already is So lets hope for the best PCE
C80A11	7	positive	  Homework Review   Zheng Yuan   Program   Help us understand how to implement word co occurrence MAPREDUCE program using the pairs approach   Help us understand the limit of the implementation we did before   Program   Help us get a clear concept of how to do the matrix matrix multiplication by using Mapreduce  Help us know the concept of stripes and communication cost  Program   Help us understand how to get a pagerank  Help us understand different ways to represent graph and the strong point weakness for each way  
C83E61	5	neutral	 This assignment is more difficult than previous one I had to look for Hadoop APIs and slides in order to understand the idea of combiner partitioning and DistributedCache But I did learn a lot and had some idea of why TF IDF is useful especially after completing the very last question of Problem And I found some of my Bayesin Statistics basics as well It is interesting to see how different subjects are interacting with each other The class is getting tough but it is fun to play around with MapReduce 
C87660	6	positive	 My partner and I have a great time doing this homework Though there are many aspects we do not understand in the beginning we discussed a lot and searched the Internet to get good references It is a pleasure to see our program running successfully We also make great process I am very happy to work this out by my own 
C8A9F0	4	negative	 Homework has done a good job to remind us of what we ve learnt in past lectures such as run MR program with parameters test MR program locally and test MR program using unit test And the new log file has deepened our understanding about MR program  Using the senario of web log analysis problem lead us through all we ve learnt and made us to implement them However I would like to say that the homework has been confusing Some questions of the hw though related closely to what we learnt took quite amount of time for us to get the point behind it And the points are so detailed that they may not be covered in lecture 
C9881B	3	positive	 Homework is a good way for us to refine our understanding of the excution process of the MapReduce algorithm the average word length program has right difficulty for us based on the word count program we ve read Also by going through problem I deepened the understanding about how MapReduce programs are executed and I realized the importance of effective debugging methods However for problem the problem statement is ambiguous which took extra time for us to guess what are the real point of the question 
C9B01F	8	positive	 Overall I think the homework is very helpful in terms of practicing the very foundamentals of the algorithm of building recommendation systems I do feel implementing mapreduce job in java is kind of a hassle especially for simple tasks like sorting My teammate and I struggled as to how to run the two jobs without getting error in the terminal Fortunately we figured it out 
CA04CF	4	neutral	 This homework was much lengthier and more complicated than any homework we had done so far  There were many times that I was unsure if I would be able to do part of it and alot of the directions were vague enough were I was unsure if I was even doing the task that I was supposed to be doing  I would not have been able to do this homework without partner and TA help 
CAE971	1	negative	 This homework felt a bit tedious and frustrating The second problem was particularly frustrating because I had a small mistake in my formula that gave some correct results but it wasn t clear what I was doing wrong My issues with the first problem were mostly having to explain each dimension even if it felt unnecessary and the lack of examples given in the notes for a more nuanced understanding of each dimension 
CAF0BF	6	positive	 This is a busy week we are busy on the midterm review And this time s homework is very interesting Especially the problem one and problem three And it is really useful too We can later use this knowledge to do many things such as data analysis and data mining That s all 
CC1CCB	7	negative	 For the problems in this homework I feel terrible fighting the ambiguity in problems In problem II b based on the text we should calculate out the input size but the description tells us to count in pairs emitted Also writing pseudo code without any example is also time consuming Since there are lots of different methods online to write pseudo code workload and elegancy differs quite a lot So I think it is very urgent to get a example on pseudo code Also it would be nice if TA can strictly grade our answer according to what the problem description wants especially for the odd number Homework 
CC3F87	2	positive	 This homework is more difficult than the last one we need to actually do some sort of research before we get an proper answer especially the last problem I read about the shortcuts and command line cheatsheet and didn t find an answer of how to search for certain pattern in a text file However I pressed h to view the helper inside the terminal the I knew how to search with pattern Also pressing n or N can do previous search in different directions which can lead to different searching results I learned something new I feel progressing 
CCEC38	1	positive	 This homework is the first homework for Marion s cloud computing class I have to write this review because I need that bonus points This problem set contains problems and it took me longer to finish than expected I like it when I can do the probability quiz as in the book and I dislike that long essay I had t read Hey I think I ve written words for now Thanks for reading 
CE8DC4	8	positive	 Homework was a good practice exercise in implementing recommendation systems algorithm specifically the top N list and also helped us understand how similarity between items is determined I t also helped me get my feet wet with Pig and Hive two very powerful platforms for big data analysis and yet very intuitive for programmers 
CE9D6F	7	neutral	 THis homework was very intereseting in that it allowed us to do matrix operations to solve pagerank a real world application This was both cool to see work and a bit confusing because one of the questions requested that I use taxation on a graph without any taps which resulted in all probabilities to I still dont know if this is the right answer and did not know that I was unable to get any confirmation on if this was the correct appraoch intention of the problem Otherwise it wasrelatively straightforward and a good set of conceptual exercises 
D02D0C	5	positive	 Since I am not familiar with how to read txt and use it in Java I spent a ton of time on learning how to code to load the positive words txt and nagetive words txt I really should learn java well before then But I feel happy that I learned more on this homework Generally homework five is not bad 
D17E3F	7	positive	 This homework was a little better than some of the last ones The questions were still vague at times but at least they were solvable I really liked the fact that they had stuff that pulled from the textbook Teamwork was very helpful while doing this assignment and I think the combination of my partner and I brought alot to the table together 
D210BD	4	positive	 I love this homework It serves as an excellent review so far in this course and it is kinda like a step by step instruction that helps me writing my first mapreduce job It clearly lays out different testing method i e testing locally using Eclipse commandline toolrunner and pseudo cluster which really makes things a lot more clear for me Thumb up 
D27FF8	3	neutral	 I think hw is a bit challenging overall but it also made me understand more deeply about the relationship between driver mapper and reducer and how to implement each of them as well One thing I am still kind of confused about is YARN scheduler Another concept i m not so sure about is skew Q and Q seem to cover some topics that professor didn t spend much time on in the lecture 
D299C8	2	neutral	 I found this homework to be rather enjoyable at times and occaisonally frustrating For one on question when we were supposed to find each frequency of a certain list of words I didn t know how to search the mapReduce output file for the specific words and thus it was time consuming to have to scroll through and find each one I did enjoy questions and which were both examples in which we were supposed to work out each step in the MapReduce process I found these two questions pleasantly thought invoking while I thought the fourth question was mostly frustrating I prefer working out little problems instead of explaining concepts in words 
D36D38	3	positive	 The overall problems are all easy to deal with and needs deep comprehension about java coding and mapreduce system The first problem test the conception of skew on reducer and it is really important to learn the fundamental conception that reducer work only after all mapper finished their work and reducer runs sequentially itself and parallel over reducers The second and third questions are also easy and test the fundamental conception 
D6BC72	3	neutral	 This assignment was very hands on and I enjoyed that there was a coding aspect to it Actual writing the mapper and reducer functions gave a better understanding of they work I did have some troubles with getting the job to run in the HDFS which I did not like and it gave me some troubles However because of the lab I was able to run it locally with the same input and that gave me the desired input which was much appreciated 
D79DC1	5	positive	 This hw is more difficult than past homeworks Although there are less problems in this homework and less questions in one problem However this homeword took me more efforts than before Lab instructions and examples on the slides are not that enough to guide us step by step The partitionerTest java file comes with bugs which we need to fix by ourselves This homeword requires us to go thourgh past lab instructions and slides to be inspired of how to do the homework Writing a test this time requires us to use assert equals Also this time our job is to build a jar with almost all stuffs and command lines we learned before 
D8ADCC	8	positive	 This homework is requires some programming skill and I think it s at right diffculty and the ambiguity to me is less The problems in the homework are useful for us to understand all the lecture slides and improved the practical implementing skills of us I do think that this homework is one of the tops among all the homeworks 
D92B32	5	negative	 I had a bit of trouble with making the partitioning test I knew my partitioner worked but a forgot about that the file paths Also for some reason my results for word count and word count with combiner had the combiner having the lower amount of time doing map task but the question d asks why the total time spent for the mapppers is higher when using a combiner I had the same output and there is evidence that the combiner ran so I have no idea why I had different results
D9BA1E	5	positive	 This homework was a really good learning experience with some real world applications which is nice I m not sure where the class materials went over how to use files with the partitioner but google was able to help I think this homework was probably my favority so far in terms of length and material 
DB1003	8	neutral	 This assignment felt particularly practical which was nice Part was a little stressful without stubs but we figured it out eventually However I am just very ready to graduate I am starting to worry about the exam because there is a lot of material in this class that I understand as I am doing it but have not necessarily retained well 
DD18B5	3	positive	 This homework is hard It took me and my partner a lot of energy and time to figure out everything However it is really excited and a good sport I feel that I understand the structure of MapReduce and how the driver mapper and reducer work much better Also the command line starts to become my new best friend I start to in love with Linux 
DD59CF	4	negative	 this homework has some tricky questions In question there are couple naive questions of which the resolutions can be found directly from the lecture notes It is kind of useless to answer those questions The question have c d more like lab practice but not a homework It is unclear what should we submit Also some question like test on test data and whole data are actually redundant 
DDC2A0	4	negative	 Homework is really time consuming which made me two days focusing on this home work It not only need me to write code but also takes a lot of time on testing the program Moreover we spent many time on thinking the conceptual questions which are also not very easy to answer Anyway this homework make me feel tired but I did learn a lot from it 
DDFED9	1	positive	 I feel pretty good about this first assignment Even though I was really busy this semester with all the courses societies and jobs hunting I still enjoy doing this homework Plus I really like this course so far and I believe I can take away a lot of useful knowledge from this course 
DE3E92	5	negative	 This assignment involved more of me figuring things out on my own than the other assignments did so I didn t enjoy it as much We weren t given examples on how to implement unit tests for partitioners so I struggled on how to write the code for that especially since I had to run the test in Eclipse and had to supply the arguments for the DistributedCache through Eclipse which we never really went over 
DE7395	5	positive	 Homework is a good exercise in understanding how combiners and partitioners work and how to implement them It also helps us get more insights into sentiment analysis In particular we learn the most basic approach to it and also think about its limitations and ways to improve on that approach 
DFF2A5	1	negative	 This first homework was longer than expected and quite tedious It required going back into the lecture notes and readings to extract and summarize information The probability problem took a while and ultimately I don t think it was necessary to understand the concept Overall it wasn t the worst homework I have been assigned but I also didn t enjoy it 
E0E0C8	6	negative	 In homework I think it is easier to understanding following the code in the slide But there is still one thing hard to learn is how to decide what kind of type of value At the same time in question I have confuse about the type of data type in the first line of compress file And there are many unknown mark inside the file 
E27B65	8	positive	 This is a fair homework The first question actually help us learn how to create a project from a fresh begining However I get some problem with that So I think professor should give a tutorial on that at the first couple labs It turns out that we have to import an external lib which is a bit hard for people like me who is not that familiar with ecilipse The next couple questions are instructive From that I learn deeper on the recommend system and how some of them works It is helpful if we can do a project on this 
E3CF37	6	positive	 This hw took too long a time for doing The main reason is that there is few examples and slides didn t give enough hints I think I don t have a good understanding of the contents and methods or concepts for these several slides I feel it very hard to do such problems I need to admit that it is a good choice of problem and really make you gain a lot but it is difficult actually I get a positive feeling for that but still want to improve my efficiency on such things 
E55AD1	6	negative	 The homeworks keep taking longer and longer to finish This homework had me and my partner very frustrated with debugging errors and unclear directions for where to go I honestly didn t like this homework very much I wish doing the homeworks involved less annoying debugging tasks and more implementation of concepts from class I also heard that a lot of what we re doing is outdated That would be very tragic if true 
E5C419	5	negative	 I think hw is a bit difficult especially with the Partitioner part It was consufing at first because the code setup was a little bit off and the execution is sort of different from previous MapReduce java programs But I still figured out a way to handle and debug it I am not so sure about the number of bytes read count as there are counters for that one for File the other for HDFS I only reported the File one though 
E66573	1	positive	 I thought this was an interesting homework assignment I really enjoyed questions and but problem was a bit vague in my opinion and the information needed wasn t fully covered in the article I like the problem based questions where we have to think about the concepts learned in class and apply them to questions at home 
E6F2A9	8	positive	 This homework is much easier than the previous two And the questions asked are clearer and understandable It is a good review of the lecture content and also brings some valuable coding experience I am happy that this homework is pretty good and I hope the coming homework can be like this one 
E6F7DF	8	positive	 This is a busy week we are busy on the midterm review And this time s homework is very interesting Especially the problem one and problem three And it is really useful too We can later use this knowledge to do many things such as data analysis and data mining That s all 
E7AFD5	7	negative	 This hw is totally a disaster Coding is good only need to pay attention to some details but the writing part is really really making me depressed We need to write the map in map out reduce in reduce out by hand I don t know what is meaning of these things We can write the java code and run and bang that is the result Why do we need to calculate the value using basic math and then fill them one by one It is just like human computer I feel very bad for these homework and still get very confused about some problems This hw is driving me mad Tha is all my feelings about that 
E7C83E	3	positive	 This homework assignment caused me a little stress Problem took the longs time because I felt like it was a little confusing with the amount of material given I had to do outside research to come up with the answer I like how problem gave me the opportunity to apply the skills learned in lecture to an assignment This problem helped me further understand the concepts we have been reading about by applying it to a simulated data set Overall this assignment was good 
E90080	6	negative	 I felt more lost on this homework than the others I have been having trouble focusing in class so the material was fuzzier to me going in Also my schedule was very full this week so it was hard to find time to work with my partner Hopefully over spring break I will have time to study to get a better grasp of this material 
E99335	4	negative	 This HW is another combination of previous labs and homework assignment The coding part of this homework is not so tough however the questions are kind of hard to answer since I can not fully understand the point for these questions sort of Hope the latter homework questions could be more specific 
E9F884	6	negative	 This home work is really wasting of time We have to implemented many java files Even though we don t have to code a lot we spend a lot time on testing the output which I feel is a not a good idea I am looking forward to implement something related to the Google matrix 
EA352A	4	positive	 I feel hw is much harder than hw but the thing I like about this homework is that it pushed me to really dig into building MapReduce for different tasks I find the problem e a bit vague as to what job management means here But the whole assignment is actually very interesting 
EA7AEC	1	positive	 In my opinion this homework is very helpful for us to understand the new knowledge that we just learnt from the lecture and it urges us to read the materials carefully which is very useful for us to remember the theory and knowledge well But I have to say that the paper that we have to read in this section is a little bit long which cost me over hours to understand it well but this is also good for developing my English reading skill 
EB5B7A	4	positive	 This is the forth homework now and I am still writing the review When I first received homework I found that it contained problems and the first one was toolrunner the second one was question about test I have learnt in class so this was pretty easy for me Although it was easy I still got several questions so I went to TA asked the questions and all solved in an afternoon I feel relieved 
EBC20E	9	negative	 For the problems in hw I have the sense that this homework is very time consuming since pig workload is heavy and will cost us a lot of time to wait for the result but the error check mechanism is not so good which led us to fail for a lot of times so that lots of time wasted Meanwhile it proved the importance to me that we shall do as discrete small sample test as possbile 
EC7104	5	negative	 Homework has been pretty frustrating for me On the first problem I had a difficult time coming up with an example for when the Reducer cannot be used as the Combiner It was somewhat interesting to compare the counters for the job with combiner vs without but it was mostly annoying to make sure I was reading the right numbers and calculating the correct residuals I also did not like that this question mostly involved written conceptual answers instead of actual problem solving The second problem was a bit more enjoyable for me although figuring out the SentimentPartitionTest java was tricky at first I enjoyed the challege of figuring out what to do 
ECA39C	4	positive	 It is helpful to practice specifying configuration options for the programs by ToolRunner and I appreciate the chance to set parameters by configuration in problem Problem basically lets us try out different ways to test our programs locally which can be more convenient and efficient for debugging And I think it will be great if we can try to run a real Hadoop cluster 
ECD333	2	positive	 This homework is very helpful for us to understand and remember the context that we learnt in the last lecture better I got a better understanding about the map reduce and learned more about the using and techniques of it And I also got more familiar to the using of the Hadoop got used to the basic commend of it 
F02EDF	6	positive	 I thought homework was a pretty fun assignment Despite the fact that I had a busy week and a debilitating migraine for the majority of it thus I ended up having to rush to get hw done at the last minute it was an interesting challenge and I appreciated the task of implementing new types of mapreduce programs I especially enjoyed the inverted index question The sequence file was a bit more boring because it didn t involve very much problem solving 
F19801	7	negative	 This homework was way tougher than previous one One reason was that I didn t have a lot of time studying textbook and slides because of midterms of other classes so I had some hard time going back and forward between contexts Also the third part of the problem page rank was not carefully delived in class so I didn t know how to do a lot of things by simply studying lecture notes So I had to google a lot But thanks God I finally completed this homework during my first day of Spring Break in Canada Don t like the feeling of doing homework when I am on break 
F23AE2	7	negative	 I have done my homework problem and and following is the review The write up part which is problem is easy for me because after I read the MMDS section  and  the problem for me is easy to solve But for problem I debugged a lot of time and I with my partner debugged several times as well because we did not have any relative programing knowledge for co occurrence except in class so we have to google a lot to find out and this took some time 
F2EF83	4	negative	 I think this homework takes significantly longer than the previous ones as a weekly homework although it could be just me not having a partner at all I wish there could be a more even distribution of the homework throughout the semesters so that we have better expectations at the begining of the course I do think the homework is particularly helpful for real world applicaitons considering the questions are very specific and practical I wish the next homework could be broken into two if it is as long as this one 
F35943	3	positive	 I enjoyed this assignment also especially the third question where we had to write our own MapReduce program It wasn t too much of a challenge since I just looked at the code from WordCount and made modifications The second question helped reinforce the sequence of events in the YARN process for me since we sped through it in lecture 
F55CF7	1	positive	 With the help of reading material the textbook the lab work I find this homework is a very good prctice of the knowledge we learn in the course Actually I enjoy this homework Also the partership with my classmate works well With the discussion we both learned a lot 
F56E9F	9	positive	 I found homework to be pretty enjoyable I prefer using Python so it was nice to be able to implement at least part of the homework in pyspark Otherwise PIG is a bit repetitive and can seem tedious but also I can see how it s really useful and I m happy to start adding it to my repetoire of CS skills I also liked that this week was a project for Dualcore it tied the class material into relevant real life applications Overall homework might have been my favorite homework assignment yet We ll see I still have some left to do 
F59CB5	1	positive	 For this homework problem helps a lot on understanding the properties of big data especially the difference between structured semi structured and un structured Problem is mainly about calculating probability After making some mistakes I finally make it right The article for last problem about learning from text is interesting The idea to processing human language is always an interesting topic 
F66563	6	positive	 During our work in homework we endeavored to complete customizing the writable manipulation on sequence files and Snappy along with inverted indexing on words The problem set help us to review the content in lecture correspondingly and is with right difficulty but the workload of the problem is a bit more than enough Also in problem it took a long time for the job to be completed though it is necessary to teach us how cloud computing really works and the problem doesn t require us to submit the job it will be helpful if we can get a early warning on the time consumption 
F6F2F0	3	positive	 This homework is very comprehensive with more practices in programming and more basic explanations of Hadoop MapReduce The first problem is related to basic statistics which makes students think more about the efficiency of MapReduce The second problem is explanation related to YARN which makes student understand more of the process of job execution The third problem is very nice with practices and I hope that more programming assignments will be given in the future Also it would be nice if students could have more data sets to practice with the MapReduce jobs not limited to word count program In sum this is a very good homework assignment with comprehensive questions to be answered 
F7F6DB	5	negative	 I had a very busy week so I wasn t able to turn the homework in on time It was really frustrating to realize that I couldn t finish the homework as fast as I expected and we had to work until Sunday morning to finalize our results I wanted to improve on this when we turned in late last time Next time we should definitely plan ahead and get started earlier 
F80DF7	6	negative	 This assignment was frustrating I felt like we had to figure a lot of these things out ourselves which I understand is supposed to be part of the learning experience but there was very little guidance given in the lecture slides Many of the things we had to implement I had to seek help for on StackOverflow like the SequenceFileWriter The demo provided seemed a bit outdated and a lot of modifications were made on my part to adapt the code to its intended purpose 
F83D07	3	positive	 This homework was more difficult than previous ones This I think is due to the questions being a little bit more vague than previously  The third question was all or nothing and took lots of thought to figure out At times this was frustrating but in the end I think that I learned more because of it 
F89970	2	positive	 Homeword consists schematic problems numerical problems and also some subjective questions In order to complete this homework we need first go through the lab and lab as well as the lab slides of the introduction of MapReduce I feel better doing this homework than I did homework because I am getting more closed to the HDFS which makes me feel excited 
F8A944	4	positive	 Cloud computing is a practical technologies which is widely used in daily life The popularity of cloud computing makes this course so important for people even have different background Actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting The problems mainly includes all aspects of knowledge related to cloud computing I finished reviewing the information in the book slides and lab 
FB030E	2	positive	 I enjoyed this homework because it was challenging enough that I really had to work but doable so I was able to complete most of it on my own It also took a good amount of time for a weekly hw in my opinion Overall I thought it was very fair and a great learning experience 
FBC836	6	positive	 This homework introduces a further function of MapReduce process and how to make the process more efficient The homework is a good review of the lecture and offers valuable coding experience to me which gives me a deeper understanding about both the concepts of the class and how to realize it by myself 
FC2DD4	4	positive	 Homework is overall interesting and somewhat challenging It helps me solidify my understanding of ToolRunner and how configurations work in Hadoop as well as the difference between running a map reduce job locally and on a cluster It is also a good exercise in Java code However some of the questions could have been worded better so as not to cause confusion or provided a little bit more context as to what certain terms mean 
FD3448	7	negative	 This homework is really confusing especially the second problem I do not know what are the he required two mapreduce programs in part a meaning So it takes me such long time to understand and think through the problems The first and the third questions are relatively good and give nice review for the lecture 
FDBED9	5	negative	 Very intersting homework In this one professor Newman teaches us how to use combiner and partitioner in our code On the one hand the combiners make the process of reduction more efficient by pre reduce some of the keys so that there are less key pairs sending to the actual reducer On the other hand the partitioner help with distributing the blocks of files to the reducer This helps a lot really
