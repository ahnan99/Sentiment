The first problem is somewhat easy to get. Basically, those are what we are mentioned in class.
The second problem is a bit complicated becasue you need to be careful when checking the formulas. The good part is we can find an example, although simplified, from textbook.  That saves my life.
The third problem is dull and as it said "unreasonable". Granted I like the fact it reveals. It tries to hide that simple notion: "Model Sucks, go for more Data". Seriously, a student with no background of ML and NLP may have a hard time find the key idea of this article.
