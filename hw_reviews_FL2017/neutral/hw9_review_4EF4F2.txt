This homework is really long compared to the last one but point-wise, it's  the same. Some students expressed frustration over this fact. I'm ok with it since everyone is hold to the same standard. If I don't get A, it's fine. Problem 2 is hard for me because I'm not well versed in matrix math. Hopefully this homework wont be too bad.
