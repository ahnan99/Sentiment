I thought this homework was interesting. I definitely found it harder than the other homeworks thus far, but it was 
nice that it was so procedural. The directions for this homework were very clear. However, I found it very hard to
find the information needed to answer some of the questions, as that information was scattered across mutliple
powerpoints from class. It was definitely a homework that built upon our classwork. Lastly, I liked that it was so 
hands-on, and less conceptual than some of our other homeworks have been so far.
