Some parts of this homework were quite confusing, but once I took the problem step by step, it was doable. Problem one was fairly easy to determine and justify. Problem two was very challenging at first, but it all made sense at the end. Problem three was also slightly challenging and took some time to complete since the answers to the questions were not obvious from the reading. I had to carefully read the article to understand and answer the questions. Overall, after finishing the homework, it was not too bad.
