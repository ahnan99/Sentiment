Problem 1 was pretty alright, no major complaints there.  Only thing worth mentioning is that I was totally unable to find "Table 8-7" in HTDG. I'm not sure if there's some appendix that I haven't found, but I couldn't find any tables in Chapter 8 beyond Table 8-4.  Example 8-4 was pretty helpful though, that would be a better reference.  Problem 2 was fine.  Problem 3 was a real pain. It's easy to imagine someone with a solid understanding of the material might lose points on copying errors. I checked my word like 4 times and I'm still not sure that I didn't make any typos are hard to catch. All in all, not too bad; it'll really come down to how it's graded.
