This homework is fairly short compared to the last one. However, it requires some deep reading. Not only do I need to read, I also have to understand beyond what the book tells me. I like how question 3 makes me think about how the entire hadoop map reduce framework works. I guess that's ok since we need to understand deep enough for the test and also for the future work that we're going to be doing.
