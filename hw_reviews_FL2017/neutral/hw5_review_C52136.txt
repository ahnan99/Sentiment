I did not think this homework was that bad. I do believe it was a slightly harder than the previous homework because I did not really give myself enough time to finish the homework to the best of my ability. If I read the slides in more depth then the homework would not have been too bad.Also, I feel like this homework contained a bit more theoretical questions than I would have liked.
