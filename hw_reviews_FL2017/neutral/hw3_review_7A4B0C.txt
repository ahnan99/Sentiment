This assignment was somewhat less interesting than homework 2. The reason is because I felt this assignment was more theoretical than application. The main reason I liked questions 1a and 1b is because in order to answer those questions youhad to complete something in the virtual machine. All the other questions were mainly questons that answered "What if?".
