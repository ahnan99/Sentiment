Overall, it wasn't too bad.  My main gripes lie with Problem 1.  I see the benefit of getting comfortable the six dimensions of big data and learning how they apply to different data sets, but debating whether or not data sets meet loosely-defined criteria seems like a needlessly semantic exercise.  It's also pretty amibiguous in places and dealing with this ambiguity accounted for a good amount of the time I spent working on this assignment. It was one of those assignments where I was never sure if I was answering the question that the instructions wanted me to answer, making it pretty uncomfortable to work on.  Problem 2 was the best, by virtue of being the most concrete.  Felt like a solid way of internalizing Bonferonni's principle.  Problem 3 was okay, although I felt like I was really grasping at straws to figure out what more there is to say about labeled vs unlabeled data and I guess I won't know until I get the assignment back whether I said enough.  Hoping future assignments are a little more concrete and a little more direct about what they expect.
