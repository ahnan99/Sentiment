This week is a busy week (with mid-term exams). Spend at around 10 hours on this weekâ€™s homework (including the lab part). I have to look up slides from lectures before to help figure out how to transfer the movie id number to the movie name. This is the most difficult part in this homework. 
Always have lot of work to do after class.
