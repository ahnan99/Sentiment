I found the homework assignment interesting, but slightly frustrating. I enjoyed having the combination of reading assignment problems combined with the math problem. However, I was slightly confused in that I was unsure of how long each answer should be for the literary analysis problems. I was unclear on the level of detail I should provide. Lastly, I was odd, but not bad, that we weren't really familiar with the topics involved in the math problem. Overall, I thought the level of difficulty for the problems was decent, and I enjoyed the opportunity to obtain extra credit.
