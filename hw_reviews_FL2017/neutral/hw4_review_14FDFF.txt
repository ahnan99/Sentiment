This assignment took a little longer than I had anticipated. I just barely met the deadline this time, having to use a couple extra days to finish it. It was both frustrating and stressful to complete this one as I got stuck a few times. However, it was much more rewarding once everything was working properly, and I recieved what I believe to be proper results. I will definitely try to allot myself more time for the next assignment.
