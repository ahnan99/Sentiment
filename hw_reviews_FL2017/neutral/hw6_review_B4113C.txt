I thought this homework was relatively challenging. It was quite annoying to have to change our toolrunner file for each test between the different jobs. Howevever, I did find this assignment quite interesting as we were using mapreduce to determine information that is potentially used in all of our day to day lives such as in netflix. Overall, I thought this homework was hard but rewarding.
