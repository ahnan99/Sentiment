This part is not hard, but it is a bid confusing. Especially for the first part, in order to use the fileSplit you need to include some header. Unfortunately Eclipse gives no clue. Worsely, there are two possible headers from two different versions of API, with only one working. This part takes me some time. But I do think the last question is good, it gives more intuition about the definition of similarity; you cannot just plugin the formula, you also need to think the meaning of the formula. I think it makes sense. But I do not like Problem 2.a, I think it's too straitforward to prove.
