This homework is ok. I got stuck in implementing the reverse indexer. I had trouble with the input format. I search every corner I could to learn how to set the separator for reading in a line directly as key and value. But I failed to find detailed information. There are examples online, but they didn¡¯t work for me. The rest is not difficult. Proving normalized cosine distance equals to pearson correlation is a trivial task- it¡¯s not worth proving.
