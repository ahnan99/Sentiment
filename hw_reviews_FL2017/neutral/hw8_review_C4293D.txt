This homework was again equally frustrating and enjoyable. I am enjoying learning spark, especially the operations and transformations. I've realized that I like working with data sets and manipulating / transforming data. What's more, I'm excited about learning spark. I decided to go with spark rather than python withthe idea of trying to add another language to my arsenal. The frustrating part was just scrambling to finish everything in time, which is partly my fault. Virtual box and svn gave me issues again which is getting old, but all in all I've enjoyed working with spark so far.
