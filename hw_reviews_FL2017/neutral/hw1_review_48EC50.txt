Starting the first homework for a new course can always be a bit stressful as you don't always know what to expect or how much time it will take. Judging from the feedback on this homework, one can better judge how to perform the homeworks for the rest of the semester. Question 2 gave me the most frustration, as it took me much longer to figure out than I thought it would. Once I got it, though, my confidence in my statistical abilities was restored. I get confused sometimes when asked to answer questions on an article, as I'm not always sure I'm answering the same material the question is asking.
