Homework 2 was similar to homework 1 in that it was very straightforward. The questions were fairly easy to answer and there was not much ambiguity. I understand that we need to learn the concepts, but these questions seem to me to be overly simplistic. More questions about types of mappers or reducers or implementing simple ones would be more instructive. Perhaps that is to come in the next homework.
