This homework assignment wasn't too bad. I felt like it was a good introduction to Spark. However, some of the questions I felt were pretty vague. We had to go to TA hours just to ask if one of the questions is what you were looking for. It's a bit annoying when a question is open-ended or vague, but the graders expect a specific answer. I feel like I understand everything conceptually; it's just a matter of figuring out exactly what the questions are asking.
