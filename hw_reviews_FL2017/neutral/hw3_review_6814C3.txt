My review for Homework 3 is neutral for the most part. The questions were fairly straightforward which translated to a period of work that was mostly satisfying and rewarding. My only negative sentiments came from problem 2, because I struggled to come to an understanding of the questions regarding skew. A slight feeling of frustration also followed the assignment because it took longer than I wanted it too.
