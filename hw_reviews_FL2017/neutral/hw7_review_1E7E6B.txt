The inverted index implementation was a more real-life application of using Map Reduce at large scale. The index would be the basis of additional text mining algorithms. Normalization is an important part of collaborative filtering. It really makes a difference in the cosine angle and the direction of Pearson. The effect of positive vs negative is a more accurate representation of user ratings. The item-item utility matrix also improves the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.
