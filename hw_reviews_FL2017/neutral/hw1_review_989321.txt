This homework introduced a lot of material that was new, but served as the basis for a lot of the material in the class. While it was mostly new material, I enjoyed learning about Bonferroni's principle. Sometimes the homework was ambiguous on what it was looking for as the answer. Due to this, answering some of the questions took a lot of time and thought and made it a bit overwhelming at times considering we have just started learning about the material. I liked learning about the concepts in the homework.
