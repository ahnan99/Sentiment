Problems 1 and 2 weren’t terribly difficult or time-consuming, especially since we did the lab that problem 1 is based off on in class. For problem 3, I had some difficulty in understanding the YARN process from the lecture and lecture slides alone; I think it’s difficult to follow a graphic, and further clarification was needed. Overall, it didn’t take a long time and I only struggled on understanding problem 3. I don’t necessarily understand why we focused on YARN this week; I understand it’s an ‘under the hood’ concept, but I guess I place more value on understanding what MapReduce does rather than Hadoop.
