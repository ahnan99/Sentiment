This homework was both frustrating and rewarding. I got stuck for a long time trying to figure out why the job on the pseudo cluster was failing to get data from the movie titles file. It was working when I tested locally because the file was accessible in my local directory. The problem was that I was forgetting to add the file to my Distributed Cache. After I figured out this trivial error, it was smooth sailing. Once I have everything going smoothly, I really like running mapreduce jobs and working with big data. It is very satisfying to watch a job run and see massive amounts of data be parsed and manipulated according to our jobs.
