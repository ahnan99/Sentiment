The homework was not particularly difficult or time-consuming. I had more issues acquainting myself with the turn-in process in Gradescope than the problems. Altogether, the material from lectures and the MMD book was sufficient to complete the homework. I will comment that problem 2 was worded rather ambiguously, where I didn’t know what was meant when it referred to “Data-based approach”. This was later clarified by Professor Neumann on a Piazza post, but I think it could be worded better.
