It was interesting to build a MapReduce pipeline purely from scratch, though with significant resources proposed for reference on how to get started and a lot of the code was similar to that previously written. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing though since I think it helps to become more comfortable with using Hadoop. A few of the conceptual questions were tricky to think of good examples of however.
