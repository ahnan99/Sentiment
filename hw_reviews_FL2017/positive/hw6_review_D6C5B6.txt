Hw6 helps us to develop a hadoop project from scratch. It is quite meaningful,although there are still some details which need to take some time to figure out how it is going on. For example, I use scanner to read the movieId as well as titles from movie_title.txt and put it into a treemap, but it seems during the excution of hadoop, there are some titles missing in the treemap which is replaced by null and it affect my running result. Hopefully, I can figure out why is that.
