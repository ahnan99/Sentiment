I think this homework is highly relative with the course documents and the class lectures, so I really need to listen every word during the lecture. It is very encouraged for me to force on the lecture. And just one thing I need to practice is that the editing skills in Word. For problem 2, we can write tidy on the paper, but transferring the formula from paper to electrical document spends some time, but it is worth.
