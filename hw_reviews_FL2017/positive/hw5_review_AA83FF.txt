This assignment was by far my favorite in this class because I think it really pushed me to understand map reduce extremely thoroughly. Now that I understand the concept and its actual implementation, I'm very looking foward to more sophisticated map reduce programs that require more complex computations! Overall this lab didn't take too long and was very informative. Thank you for this!
