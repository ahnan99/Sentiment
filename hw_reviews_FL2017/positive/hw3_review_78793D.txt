Overall, the homework is not difficult. But it requires quite a bit searching and reading. Problem 1 made me to familiarize myself with hadoop/linux commands. It was a bit frustrating to just find out how those command combinations work. I wish there were some hints, e.g. which key word to use to extract the information. Also, I was not familiar with the syntax. How to get linux commands to work on HDFS file was a problem for me. Until later, I realized what -cat does is to copy data from HDFS to the local memory. So one can perform linux commands on the local copy.Problem 2 is good for understanding ¡°skew¡±.I just don¡¯t like the terms in the first question of problem 3. I don¡¯t think anyone would consider those when running a real hadoop job.
