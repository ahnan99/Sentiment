This assignment was really helpful in that I could be more familiar with the concepts of combiner and reducer. I could learn more about the efficiency of combiner through working on the lab and seeing the difference in results from the case when there is combiner and the case when there is no combiner. Conceputally, I could understand thoroughly in the lectures, however, I was not familiar in technical and practical way, so I think this assignment was really meaningful and beneficial. I think there is further a lot of learn about Hadoop,reducer,mapper and combiner. I really liked doing this assignment with my partner; we discussed a lot and worked on coding as a great time. I'm looking forward to doing the next one and I was really thankful for this practical assignment.
