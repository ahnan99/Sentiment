Homework assignment number 2 was not too difficult. Most of the conceptual questions had answers that were capable of being found in the hdfs book. The most interesting questions revolved around design. For example, question 1 you had to think of how space is managed on the rack and cluster to meet requirements of replication and fault tolerance. I also enjoyed the MapReduce questions since they involved a more hands-on approach to processing the flow of the data and what happens to it at different stages of the MapReduce pipeline.
