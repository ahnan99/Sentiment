The first problem in the homework gave us basic understanding of the properties of big data. We got to review the slides and give the answers. This is helpful because the concepts are more solid. The second question was more technical and involved calculating probabilities. The example in the book helped a lot, and the hint enabled us to check out answers, which was very useful. The third problem was more like a reading comprehension problem. We got to know more about data from that question.
