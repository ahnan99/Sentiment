I did not like this homework assignment. Before continuing, I though the first problem and the third problem were alright and I feel fine about the concepts discussed in them. However, I disliked problem three and think it is poorly worded and open to several interpretations. In addition, I didn't feel that skew was covered enough in the course. The little blurb in the mmds book isn't detailed enough and I'd like to have seen some explicit examples discussed.
