This homework is mostly focused on examining the data flow of MapReduce job execution, the concepts of resource manager and node managers, and the job execution practice in Hadoop. It is a very comprehensive and wisely-designed assignment. It covers every important corners of what has been taught in class. And it combines real practice and understanding of core concepts, which allows students to effectively review the course contents. Particularly, those questions can help students spot the most important content appearing in the textbook and pretty well encourage students to read the books in depth. I like this homework a lot.
