This homework seemed like it was just a repition of things we have done in previous labs. The only new thing that it introduced for me that I enjoyed was the co-occurrence problems. It helped put into perspective all the things to consider when creating a program like this, including any issues that might arrise in a pairs approach. Overall, this homework was good in providing reinforcement of previous labs and an introduction to something new.
