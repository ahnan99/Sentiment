Homework 5 is relatively an easy one. I managed to finish it fluently and quickly. In fact it is even easier than homework 1. Pretty happy about it. I used to hink there should be something about secondary sort, which will be complicated. Luckily, that is not the case. So happy about it. I hope homework 6 is similar, since fall break is approaching, and so are the midterms.
