In this homework, the most challenging thing for me is the problem2. Although the problem not ask me writing a code for matrix/vector multiplication, but I still write for both method (calculate normally and divided to stripes) using spark. And I realized that the datastructure using Rdd is more complicated than normal python. Moreover, due to unfamilier for the pyspark program, this problem spent me a long time for answering the question. But this homework really help me for deep understanding for pyspark program and job execution. And also for the two algorithms for the pagerank.
