In this homework, I found the tasks interesting and engaging again. The first problem went much smoother than I thought it would be, thus making it less time-consuming than I had originally thought. The second problem was also straightforward, though I did more than the problem was asking for, so I had to backtrack in my code a bit. Thus far, I have enjoyed the coding assignments, and am always keen on coding in Java.
