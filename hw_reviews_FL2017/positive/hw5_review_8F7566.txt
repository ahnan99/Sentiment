In this homework, we also did a few programming exercises. The structures of the functions are similar to the previous homework, so it is not that hard this time. We also look at the YARN resource manager, so that we can understand better the statistics of the jobs. The open-ended questions are harder to do this time, because a lot of concepts are involved, and we need to go back to the slides to look for the answer. Overall, the homework is managable, and we are able to finish it in a reasonable time.
