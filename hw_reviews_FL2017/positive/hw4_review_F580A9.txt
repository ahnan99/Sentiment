I actually liked this assignment alot more than the other assignments. The reason is because this assignment was more application/coding based. The questions weren't really based on theory. Instead all I had to do was refer to the slides and actually implement the code myself. Even though I made silly errors which delayed my progress, I'm glad I was able to get through to the end.
