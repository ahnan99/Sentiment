For this lab, I had some trouble with the data structures and later took a long time debugging it. It was helpful to re-read the slides a couple of times and keep track (one by one) how our data is allocated. Turns out I was reading the movie-id as a string, causing me to get either the wrong movie name or null. This lab was fun because I actually had a chance to use my pen and paper lol!
