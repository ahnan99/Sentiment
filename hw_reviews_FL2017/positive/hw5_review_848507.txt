This homework contains two problems which both examine the implementation of MapReduce program. The first one guides students in a way of debugging and testing the code gradually via local job and pseudo cluster. This is a wisely designed practice. However, its content is a little similar to previous lab and homework, which might make itself a bit duplicate. The second one let students better understand the communication cost, which is pretty useful.
