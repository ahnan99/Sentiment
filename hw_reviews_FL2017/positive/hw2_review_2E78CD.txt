I enjoyed this homework because it helped me further understand how storage works in HDFS. Asking about specfic commands and the way files are stored is good practice. In addition, figuring out how MapReduce works step by step was my favorite part of the homework. While some of this work was pretty simple, I am hopefull that future homeworks will let me solve complex problems with what was taught in this homework. I think homework 2 provided an excellent base for storage and MapReduce in HDFS.
