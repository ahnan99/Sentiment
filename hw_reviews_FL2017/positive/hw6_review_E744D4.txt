As the semester continues, the topics and assignments in this course become more interesting. I thought it was very interesting to create a TopN list using actual Netflix data. I found the assignment to be very straighforward, and was a little surprised that most of the first part of the assignment was completed in the lab work. I'm looking forward to the upcoming assignements where we will look at further methods for recommendation systems.
