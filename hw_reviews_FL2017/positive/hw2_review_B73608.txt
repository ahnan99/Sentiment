I think this one is better than the previous one. Specifically, problem 1 helps us to remind some hadoop commands and forces us to read some material in the book, and the material helps us to better understand the tradeoffs between block size and several factors. Problem 2 and Problem 3 is kinda the same, but as this is the main concept for this week, I think itâ€™s fine. Overall, I think this homework is good, it will be better if you can give me a good mark. lol
