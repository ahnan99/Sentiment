I like the first problem. It definitely helped me to better understand the properties of ¡°big data¡±. By comparing different data types, I start to realize each type pose its unique challenges to processing. Before getting started on analysis, understanding the properties of data is a vital step. Problem 2 warns us that we need to be cautious when mining big data. Improper test criteria can easily lead to false positive results. I don¡¯t quite like the reading. That article is not well written from a layman¡¯s perspective. There¡¯re way too many field specific terms and jargons. The worst thing is the logical flow is pretty bad. One can hardly see the structure of the article.
