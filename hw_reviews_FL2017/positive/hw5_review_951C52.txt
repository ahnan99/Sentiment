This homework was easier and less work than the previous homework. The coding part was quite repetitive since it was implementing the Tool Runner on the Driver and then coding the Mapper and using the same Reducer as the WordCount. There were some conceptual questions that was quite hard to think of at first. Also calculating the communication cost was quite confusing at first becase I struggled to figure out which numbers to use.
