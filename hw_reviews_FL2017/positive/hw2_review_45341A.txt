I was a little more confident in homework 2. The HDFS filesystem is abstract since blocks are distributed across many data nodes but the concept is fairly straightforward. I am already familiar with the unix/linux equivalent commands that are used in the hadoop fs command interface. I am also starting to get the hang of the way a Mapper and Reducer work as well as the map() and reduce() functions. Basic simple operations but the organization of those operations is important.
