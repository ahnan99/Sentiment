Homework 3 was more of the same. Easy questions, no coding. I know the next homework will have some coding and understand that the infrastructure piece of Hadoop is clearly important to understand, but I'm excited to get back to coding. Answering questions that are easily googleable doesn't do much for me. I am happy that these homweorkds give us an opportunity to boost our homework score early in the class.
