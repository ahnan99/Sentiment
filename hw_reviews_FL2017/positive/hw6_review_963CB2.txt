I really liked this assignment alot more than the other assignments. The reason is because doing the previous lab greatly helped the speed in which I was able to finish the homework. This is the first time that I had finished the homework before the preliminary deadline. Even though it was because I had alot more time on my hands, the other reason was because I just happened to start working on the lab and then glancing over the homework, I realized I was aleady almost done with it.
