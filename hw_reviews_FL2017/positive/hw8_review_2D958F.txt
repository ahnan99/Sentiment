This homework is not difficult. I like Spark more than MapReduce. It¡¯s more similar to Matlab or Julia REPL. It¡¯s really nice for exploring and experimenting how to transform data efficiently. So I think one can use Spark to get a working pipeline and implement that in MapReduce when large scale computation is needed. Not too many implementation trick to discover as programming MapReduce with Java. I¡¯m happy with that.=======
