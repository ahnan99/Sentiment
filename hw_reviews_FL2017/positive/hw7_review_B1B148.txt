Homework 7 dues two week after assigned, which made me think that it requires a lot of work. But fortunately, there are not many coding tasks. Instead, it includes some conceptual questions and math computation problems. The last problem is really good for us to understand the process of collaborative filtering without actually implementing it. I'm still not sure my answers are right for this one.
