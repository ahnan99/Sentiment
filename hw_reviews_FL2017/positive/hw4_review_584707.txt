This homework assignment was not too difficult, for the most part. I got through problem 1 fairly easy, though I was confused on parts b and parts c where the prompt asked for differences in command execution between local toolrunner and hdfs programs. Similarly, I also found problem 2 to be not too difficult as well. However, I do think it would be helpful to have optional reading available on how to improve sentiment analysis, just to see what the instructor would recommend.
