In general, I enjoy the first homework. It is an affordable homework (not too hard) to start a semester. Personally, I like the first two problems. The first problem help me to understand the concept and properties of Big data while the second problem is pure Math (and I like Math). I donâ€™t really like the last problem since I think the article is not really interesting and the structure of the article is also not too clear for me.
