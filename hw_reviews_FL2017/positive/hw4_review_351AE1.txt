I wish we went over more about Distributed cache in class. In particular, since hadoop documentation isn’t the most specific, I had trouble getting the tool runner parameter for using the local files as distributed files, and some clarity would have been nice. Additionally, it doesn’t make a ton of sense to have us implement testing, since most people don’t know how to write junit tests. Overall, I think i had more trouble getting the little bits of the homework running, more so than understanding it conceptually.
