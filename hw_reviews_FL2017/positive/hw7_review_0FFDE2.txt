I thought that this homework had a good combination of abstract concepts and physical coding. I really enjoyed learning about the more in depth differences between user-user similarity and item-item similarity. I thought that writing the mapreduce job to produce the inverted index could have been a little clearer as a got stuck a couple of times where I didn't really know the material from class. Overall I thought this was a good homework that covered our material quite well.
