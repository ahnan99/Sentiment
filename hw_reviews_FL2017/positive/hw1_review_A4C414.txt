1.As a non-engineering school student without strong computer science 
background, I appreciate your really, really detailed intrudction to 
environment setting and Linux command line. It made things much simpler 
than I expected.

2.From my perspective, this homework aims to help us understand a big picture
of what data will we use and what questions we will answer using Cloud 
Computing technique, especially the third question. I like that part and it's 
quite helpful.
