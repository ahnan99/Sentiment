This homework was one of the better ones, I think.  Problem 1 was pretty clear, and I think I was more comfortable with Spark afterward. Problem 2 was alright as well and I'm thankful the little XML parsing stubs were written for us.  The writing in 2b is a little confusing.  An excerpt from the desired RDD would make it a little clearer what the problem is asking, but I think I got it alright. Problem 3 was fine as well, although it seems to me to be I am still unsure where "operation" in 3b refers to the general operations "map", "filter", "count", etc. or specific instances of these operations where map is called with a particular function, which I think may also be called "operations".
