this homework is quite easy once you understood all the material in the slides. There are questions on piazza about certain aspect of the homework which can be answered easily by referring back to the lecture slides. But people dont do that. They prefer cookie cutter answer. Pathetic. I wished the homework could be morre challenging, but it's quite easy. This takes no time at all.
