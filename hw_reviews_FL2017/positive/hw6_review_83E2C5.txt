This homework is not hard, as its the same thing as the lab, which gives step-by-step instructions and a code example. There was no class last Thursday, so we have more time for it. As a results, we have more times to prepare other midterms, which is really really good. Though I don't have any midterm at all. By the way,the question this time seems much easier than previous ones. I think for most of them we can find the answer directly from the slides, which is pretty good. Oeverall, I like this style.
