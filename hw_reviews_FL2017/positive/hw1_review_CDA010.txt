Personally, HW1 is really meaningful for us to understand what is bigdata, and the properties of them. But for us, international student, the difficulty of this class may not the thing about big data, but the English. The reading material is a little bit long that cost us much time to understand. But it is still good for developing our English reading skill. The other point is, if I know what is (x, y) (Question 2), I can finish this homework more quickly. (I only know C(x,y))
