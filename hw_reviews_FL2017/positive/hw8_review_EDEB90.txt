This homework consist a balcanced combination of coding and writing reports. For the coding part, the SPARK code are not difficult at all. Instead, the core code only needs one line to write. Hence, it is rather an easy part. For the report, I need to find answers on slides, which helps a lot in reviewing the past courses. It is a rather good homework.
