This homework help us to understand how to use the spark to compute with the big data. We have already did a practice in the last lab, however, without the step-by-step guide, this homework did really slow especially the problem 2. We have to read the spark api and programming guide which you gave us in lab, to find the function and the command. But after finished the homework, we really can do something with spark, much more familier with the command line and understand what is the pipeline of rdd and how to use it. But at very first time, I don't know I should do all the things within rdd, I just take the value to a variable and deal like a normal python file. I hope you can give us a tip for that.
