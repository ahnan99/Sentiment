Similarly with the first hw assignment, I think exercises like these are very effective in a sense that it requires the answers to be well thought out and well explained, unlike the usual coding extensive assignments given in other CSE classes. I feel more confident in the future of this course as I believe that me and my partner is off to a good start :)!
