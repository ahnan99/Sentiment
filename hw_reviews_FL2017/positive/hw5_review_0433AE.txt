Like most of the other previous homework assignments, this one was not too bad as there are several examples discussed in class and previous labs that give hints as the how to implement the MapReduce pipeline. As discussed in class, the Mapper's needed to be implemented are fairly simple and short programs. The Reducer was the same SuMReducer from the previous wordcount assignment. I liked that there was a good amount of conceptual questions as well that make one think about what is going on under the hood when writing and running the programs we've been assigned to implement.
