Top N list is something very cool. I feel like I’m touching the 
nature of those mysterious and magic applications I saw in the 
daily life. Although implementations like top N list can be done 
much, much more easily in other statistics languages, such as R 
and SAS, than Hadoop, but it’s more than excited to me when I 
noticed that I could handle enormous size of data.
