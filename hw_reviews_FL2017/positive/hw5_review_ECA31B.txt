I thought that this homework assignment was fine. It took longer than I had hoped, but it wasn't terrible. I liked having the simplified co-occurrence before moving on to the more complicated way of doing it. Although I did feel that some of the questions were a little vague and difficult to understand exactly what they were looking for. Hopefully, that doesn't affect our grade.
