This homework was a little longer compared to other homework. The first two problems were good review questions for the exam. The last three problems give us opportunity to practice PIG. The questions asked very detailed concepts about Spark, so we had to go over the sides to find the answers. I liked the questions about PIG because we could actually process data and saw the results.
