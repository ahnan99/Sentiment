This homework was enjoyable to complete. It provided a lot of practice in applications of MapReduce and big data. Applying our skill towards comparing similarities in data was fun to complete. Since big data is very useful in many different fields, I felt that this homework helped me to learn more about how the concepts are used in the real world. This homework also allowed me to come up with possible ideas for projects I can make using the skills learned in this class. Overall, I liked this homework a lot.
