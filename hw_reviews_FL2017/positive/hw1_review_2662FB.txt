This homework is designed reasonably well as a good starting point exercise. The first problem is a basic test on students¡¯ understanding of big data concepts through looking into various types of data points. The only imperfection is that the section (d) is a bit ambiguous in terms of asking the difference and implication. The second problem is a nice practice of probability skills. And it also extends what students read from textbook with more insight of the similar problem. The third one is to test students¡¯ reading and summary skills, which is good for encouraging students to read more on their own but might be not so effective in terms of enhancing students hand-on skills. The bonus problem is a great practice of taking advantage of review for the course to produce resources for coursework. In a nutshell, this homework is well organized.
