Coming into this lab, at first I wasn't sure of how exactly spark will help us with our programs. However, as me and my partner went through the lab and hw, we were able to see how our data from hdfs formats itself into RDD and how we can use transformations and actions to get our desired output. Like the previous labs, I found this one very educational and highly prooductive! Thanks!
