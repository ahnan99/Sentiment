This homework help us to review the lectures from last week and also lab1. The thing like programming, the command is easy to remember and understand if we use them. I like the homework include the basic command of hadoop which we learned in lab1. I can use it smooth next time. And the last two question help us review the idea of mapreduce function. Maybe it is better to give us a example how this work in a program. Still, the biggest problem is in the reading. There are some question I can not find from book or lecture(maybe there is the answer but I didn't find it), so I have to work through the internet and it cost a lot of time but still uncertainty.
