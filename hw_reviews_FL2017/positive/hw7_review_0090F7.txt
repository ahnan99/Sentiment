In general, I like doing homework 7. The implementation parts are very interesting. However, the theoretical questions are boring, particularly question 2. I would prefer to have more implementation exercises rather than keep looking at the slides to answer the theoretical questions. Besides, question 3 helps me a lot to understand how to do mapreduce for collaborative filtering.
