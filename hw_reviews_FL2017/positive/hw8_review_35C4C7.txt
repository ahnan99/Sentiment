This homework was probably one of the shortest homeworks we had in this class. After looking up some commands about Spark, I was able to finish it fairly quickly. Also, the slides basically had most of the answers to it or all the commands we needed to know to complete this homework. Thus, it was fairly easy. It did not take a lot of time like the other homeworks so I enjoyed this homework.
