The homework could have been more clear on problem 3, but I think that’s more of a problem with the math—I can’t envision cosine similarity where you find the similarity between a non-zero vector with a zero vector. Thus, I don’t really think I understood the point of doing the dual approach, when it doesn’t really tell us any more than what we already know. It gives the similarities between items, but I fail to understand how/why it can fill missing values in the utility matrix. The rest of the homework was fine; it was just problem 3 that confused me. I think I should go look over the math again, maybe.
