I thought this homework was pretty interesting - I enjoyed how the questions were very diverse ranging from conceptual questions to math questions and finally to reading analysis. I thought the first part was in a way the most challenging as I found that certain data could be characterized in different ways. For examples, I was not sure what would constitute a 'large' amount of data versus a 'small' amount of data and what size of data would be considered large or small. Either way, I justified my answers to the best of my abilities. Overall, I thought the homework was nice in that it covered many different topics.
