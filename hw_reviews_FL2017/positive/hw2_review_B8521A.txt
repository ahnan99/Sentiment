I thought that this homework was adequately difficult. I preffered it to last weeks homework as I thought the MapReduce problems had a more direct application to the material we were learning in class. It also built on in-class assignments, which I thought was good. It was interesting to finally utelize the 'shakespeare' folder that we'd set up a couple of classes ago. Overall, I thought this homework was better suited than the last and wasn't too difficult to complete.
