For the first homework, i spend three to four hours to read the relevent articles and ppt. But i still have some confuse about the difference between the structure and complexity properties for data points. is that mean that for the structured data points, there has some fixed relationship inside the data?
but what about the complexity for the data points? 
And i still have confused about if we label data just for easy understanding about that kind of data? Why we need to annoate data and the unlabeled data can't be read by human being?
