I really like this homework. The first part is really just the lab5. The second part takes a little bit longer due to the statistic needs to be collected. I think overall I'm happy with what the homework can offer. I hope the final project will be as challenging if not more than this one. There are times I dont have a clue. The development strategy really helped me.
