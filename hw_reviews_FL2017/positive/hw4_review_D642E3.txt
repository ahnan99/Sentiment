This homework examines the students' capability of implementing a specific hadoop partitioner, passing parameters in command line and debugging the hadoop program. It requires understanding of how the partitioner works in the loop of the hadoop MapReduce program and how to add side data via distributed cache. This homework is satisfactory in terms of letting students practice coding for different parts in hadoop MapReduce. And another good thing is that the common Java API is tested in the coding process. I think this one is well-designed and worth spending time.
