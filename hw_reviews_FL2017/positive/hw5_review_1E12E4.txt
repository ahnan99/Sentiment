Alright! Getting into some good stuff now. While the implementation of both of these were pretty straightforward, I am encourage by actually getting to write some code. The word co-occurrence stuff is pretty interesting. Sentiment analysis can clearly get very complicated quickly. Coming from a finance background, the sentiment analysis driven trading is interesting. Knowing more about how this is actually being accomplished gives me pause potentially about how they are currently going about it and hope that they are using more involved algos than pair analysis!
