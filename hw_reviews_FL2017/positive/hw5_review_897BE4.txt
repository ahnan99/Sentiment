This homework help us to review the mapreduce program. The first problem is quite like the wordcount program, which we write the code before. By writting again this kind of program, we can understand how this mapper and reducer work deeply. And the question also help us to review the locations of output and input file of mapreduce program when running in hadoop, which I don't understand well before, so I read the slides of lecture and reed the textbook to find the answer.
