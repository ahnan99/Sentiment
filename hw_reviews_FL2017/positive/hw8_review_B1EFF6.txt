This homework was fun- I like using pyspark much much much more than implementing mapreduce using the hadoop framework. It’s also speedier and we don’t need to move around data to process it. I had a little trouble understanding problem 2 at first, but i think i figured it out in the end—there’s a difference between <activations> and <activation>. I think I implemented my answer correctly, but my final saved file is over 4Mbs long, which I’m not sure is correct. It seems too big for 66 entries, to be honest.
