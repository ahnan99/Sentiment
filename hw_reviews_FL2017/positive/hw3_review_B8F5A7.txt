Similar to homework 2, homework 3 was also fairly easy. Since they were mostly about understading the concepts from the book and lecture, it was easy to answer them after either reading the book or looking back at the class slides. Problem one was easy because I had already done the lab to get the results and the rest were just conceptual. Problem two was easy after reading the book. Lastly, problem three was easy if you knew what each of the daemons are in charge of.
