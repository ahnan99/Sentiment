This homework is very helpful in terms of the usage of HDFS commands and understanding of MapReduce. It has been a while since the first lab there we tried various Hadoop commands. In order to finish the first part of the homework, I have to go to lab1 instructions to look for the commands to use. It is a good way to getting familiar with the commands. The MapReduce exercises give us good hands-on experience of the process. These are useful examples of how MapReduce works, and I can get a better understanding of it.
