This homework was a great chance for me to conceptualize Spark and become more dexterous with utilizing it. Some of the problems were intriguing in that the syntaxes were unfamiliar and hard to grasp at first how to deal with those problems regarding with Spark. Also, most of the process stored in Spark and hdfs system were not tangible and not easily visualized by being saved in some storages, so it was hard to debug and keep track of what I was doing. But after we finalized this homework, we recognized it was not as hard as expected and we got satisfactory results with all the implementations, then we got some confidence in implementing Spark programming. I really liked the way everything was organized in homework and structure of the homework was so rigid and legitimate in that I could get some insights on Spark after then. Thank you and I really appreciated doing this homework.
