I think this homework help me with some basic concepts of big data, especially the properties of big data. Problem two is a mathematics problem. The article is pretty long to read and it's not that easy to understand the idea of what the author try to say. After carefully reading it for several time, I finally understand the data-based approach which is a pretty important point in the article. Personally, it's quite helpful but I think I would understand the article better ifI already have some background in big data.
