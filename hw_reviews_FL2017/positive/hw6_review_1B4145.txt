I thoroughly enjoyed completing this homework. It provided a lot of freedom and opportunity to go through the whole development process for a MapReduce job on my own. In addition, it provided a real world application and showed how important the work we are doing is. I feel confident that I can create a bit more complex MapReduce programs than I could in the past. I am excited for the upcoming labs and homeworks that this class provides since everything from here on out will be an opportunity to confidently demonstrate my skills. This homework definitely provided the opportunity to build that confidence.
