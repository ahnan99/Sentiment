This is a comprehensive homework. In problem 1, I was asked to use the virtual HDFS, which helps me to understand how to work with Hadoop in a more real setting. The other subquestions helped me to better understand how data is stored and managed in HDFS and what are the advantages and disadvantages of such storage system. Problem 2&3 are pretty much the same. I like how the questions were asked. Providing the input and output of each stages definitely helps to understand what each stage does.
