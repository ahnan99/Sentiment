Overall, I¡¯m happy with this homework. The implementations are not too hard. They seem to be more straightforward versions of the last homework. I definitely took me quit some time to finish the homework. I had to move my whole virtual machine to an external hard drive before starting this homework, and many of my previous work was gone, which is pretty frustrating. I¡¯m hoping for some questions, there can be more elaborations. I literally had no idea what ¡°input splits¡± means in the question. Or it should at least be covered and discussed in the class.
