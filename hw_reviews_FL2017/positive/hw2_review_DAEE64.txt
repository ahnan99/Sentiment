This homework was fairly easy and did not take long. It was very straightforward and easy to understand and solve. Problem one took a little more time than the other two problems just because there were several conceptual questions that required looking up in the book. Other than that, the diagram was easy to draw. For both problems two and three, it was easy and quick. Overall, this homework was very nice and easy.
