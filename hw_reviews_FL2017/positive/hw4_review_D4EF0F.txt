I enjoyed working on this lab a lot. It took much longer than the previous labs. I had a hard time working with distributed caches and tool runner. Most of my time was spent debugging the code. It was cool to see the sentiment analysis although we were looking at it word by word with no regard to context or frequency. Hopefully we'll be doing more stuff like this later on in the semester.
