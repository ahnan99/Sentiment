I did not think that this homework assignment was too difficult. For one, we did have two weeks to do it and the only programming portion was a short and easy implementation of the MapReduce job for the invert indices task. The second quesiton was purely conceptual and not too difficult either just from reading lecture slides and the book. The third question was probably the most difficult with running the similarity task via pen and paper but I believe it was still manageable.
