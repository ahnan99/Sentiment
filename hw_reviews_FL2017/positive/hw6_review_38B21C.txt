I like this homework. You can really build up the whole project step by step in the first homework problem. Building up the whole framework first then starting to fill up or perfect individual parts is an important strategy. Also, testing string/file parsing code in a separate file first is very helpful. So you don¡¯t get all the complications from the whole hadoop system. It was a bit frustrating when implementing the distributed cache. I didn¡¯t realize you don¡¯t need to add special stuff to the driver when using ToolRunner to implement distributed cache. It is actually simple.
