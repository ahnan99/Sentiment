last week i have two mid-term exams so i use the late due for the hw6, it's really cost some time. For this homework, i compare with my code to the github, i find that it use the method logger, but i don't find where i should use it. so i don't use that way to generte my code. what's the different with or without the method logger? why the github use it? but that doesn't matter, all the output should by integar, but the input txt let them all double, so i change all my output key to be double.
