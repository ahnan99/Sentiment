This homework was not as difficult nor time consuming compared to the past few homeworks. THe cosine similarity calculation was confusing at first but once I understood the formula and how each map/reduce steps work, it was easy to get to the answer. The other conceptual problems took a little bit of thinking but was not bad. The code implemntation part for problem one did not take that long so it was not bad.
