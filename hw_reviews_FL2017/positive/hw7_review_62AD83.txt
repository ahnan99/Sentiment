This homework help us to understand how to compute the item-item similarity using hadoop mapreduce, and how this method compute the similarities and what is the merit of using normalization and different similarity mesures. We can not find the answer simply through the text book and the lecture powerpoint, so we have to search a lot from internet. This help us to understand more besides the knowledge from lecture and lab. The last problem help us to clear the mapreduce operation, we can understand what this program doing clearly.
