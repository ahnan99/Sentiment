Homework assignment number one was for the most part easy. Question one ended up being highly open-ended, which was good because it allowed for several interpretations as correct answers but I found it a bad experience in that I was unsure of what the expected answer was and how pedantic grading might be regarding which justifications are detailed enough. Question two only required minor modification to the problem discussed in mmds so was not difficult. Question three was also easy to accomplish after a quick read through of the article given.
