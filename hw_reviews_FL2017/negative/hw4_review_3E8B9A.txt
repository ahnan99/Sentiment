This homework is really a difficult one, when I am trying to code the configuration, I spend a lot of time finding the best way to implement the setup function into mappers. And when I am coding partitioner, I spend a lot of time accessing txt files, and I still have trouble executing the partitioner job using command line after that. So it is a really hard homework for us to finish. I spend three days to doing so.
