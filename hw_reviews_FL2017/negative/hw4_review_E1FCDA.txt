This homework is significantly more time consuming and challenging than previus.
We spent several days to understand how toolrunner and partitioner work and get 
familiar to the environment of Hadoop. The bad thing is, from the bery beginnig,
We suffer a lot to figure put the construction of Partitiioner. But once we had 
a fundamental realization, everything gets easier and easier. Besides, I appreciate 
all the valuable helps from Dr. Neumann, TAs and classmates.
