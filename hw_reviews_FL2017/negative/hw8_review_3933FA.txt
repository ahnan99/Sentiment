this homework is not that difficult, but i still confused with the problem 2 part c), when i use map()function to extract activation from xml, it will return a list rdd result, each item in the list is another list, so i can't use getmodel() and getaccount() function in my map() function, because it can't work on the list. So i have to use flatMap() to extract activation, this will generate a list rdd and each item is a activation type index. So is there any way just using map() function instead of flatMap() then convert item in each list to activation item?
