For this homework, we have 5 major problems and 20 minor questions.
The topics range from PageRank, Spark to Pig...
 
Is that too many for one homework?
 
If this homework only worth 100 pts in total... man, I will definitely abandon set of questions.
To be honest, our graders usually deduct credit from an unperfect answer for 1~3 pts.
Attention, this credit deducted is not proportionally to the total credit for a minor question.
Which means if you lose 3pts from a 5pt question, Congrats, bro...
 
And for this homework, you will find 100 pts for 20 minor questions, which means each one get 5pts in average.
Again, for an unperfect answer... you will lose a great propotion of creadits due to many unperfect answers.
 
Thus, I highly recommend our instructor to split this homework to two individual ones and reassign the credits.

I think this homework is a tough one.  We had to learn a lot and refer to a lot of things rather than focus on only one or two aspects.
