This assignment was a little frustrating with problem two since the activations relevant stub files were nowhere to be found and it took a few days to get them via Piazza. Otherwise, the assignment was not too difficult. I felt that we could've done more examples during class however though I guess this ended up being a minor exercise in searching through API documentation. Question's one and three were both fairly straight forward in comparison.
