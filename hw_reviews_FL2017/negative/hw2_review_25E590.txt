For the homework 2, i have confused about that data nodes. I don't know whether i understand it correctly. if i send a command to the namenode to download a data, the namenode will locate the data in one data node, but it wil not check the data is vaild or not. So i have the chance to download the incorrect or invaild data. And if i download a data many times, for each time, i don't necessarily download it from one data node, because a data usually has many duplications, and the namenode will locate the data in different data node for different times. I confuse about this conception about the namenode and data node.
