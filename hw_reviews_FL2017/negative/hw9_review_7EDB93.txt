A really long homework actually. it covered many important topics including spark, pig.
BUt from it, I can see some convinience by usinng spark and pig which will get difficult and 
complex in MapReduce. But as one single homework, it's overloaded and thus I spent much time 
on it plus there are many latent readings.
