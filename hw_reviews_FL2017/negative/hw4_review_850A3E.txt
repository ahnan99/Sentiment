I didn't really like this assignment. There were a lot of little things that I was having issues with, and I wasn't able to make it to many of the TA hours. When I did go to TA hours, the TA had apparently cancelled, so I was left to struggle. It was also a pain to test this assignment, because my computer doesn't have a ton of RAM. The only way to consistently be able to run a MapReduce job without freezing up the VM was to close eclipse first, which was then very slow to start back up.
