I was not a big fan of this assignment. It was not really because of that fact that it was homework. Instead, I felt it was more of “busy work”. The question I did appreciate though was question 2 because it definitely required some deeper thinking. The last question was also a bit frustrating because I felt the article was somewhat hard to read.
