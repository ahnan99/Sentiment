I was not really a fan of this homework. One reason is because the assignement was alot longer than usual. As a whole though, the assignment was not too bad. The only question that was absolutely brutal was problem 2 because there could have been many solutions. I also wasn't very comfortable with the communication cost part so it took some time to derive the equation.
