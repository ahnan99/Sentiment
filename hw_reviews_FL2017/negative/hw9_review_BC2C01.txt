This homework was ridiculously long and somewhat difficult. It is probably one of my least favorite homework. Each problem was separated into multiple parts and some were challenging so it took a long time to figure some of the problems out. I definitely did not enjoy this homework at all. Even though we had two weeks to finish it, the first week was exam week so it was hard to work on this homework on top of studying for the exam.
