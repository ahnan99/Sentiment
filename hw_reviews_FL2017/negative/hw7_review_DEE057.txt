This homework is not that hard than previous one. But I had 
several confusions in understanding the questions. For example, 
problem 2.a, it’s a one-step derivation from cosine similarity 
to Pearson Correlation. So I have no idea what does the requirement 
“show formally” ask for. However, except this minor defect, I 
felt like this assignment expects more open ended answers which is 
the form of questions I prefer and feel at ease.
