I didn't really like this assignment. The first part was mostly about learning weird things that you can do in Hadoop. It didn't seem particularly useful, and we're creating a gigantic file at the end. The other parts were very math-focused, but I feel like we didn't really have enough information to answer the questions. The answers were either directly in the slides or glossed over and unintuitive. Hopefully, the assignments will be better once we move away from Hadoop.
