For the first problem, dude, I supposed that we will have a walkthrough about Combiner, Partitioner as well as customized Combiners. But it turns out to be merely again implementation of simple MRs.  I know the key part is how to gradually test you program and make it scale up, but I am doing this on AWS EC2 all the time. So it just some repetition work for me, honestly speaking.
For the second problem, that's not what a good problem should be: No formal input and output design; the simple testcase reveals nothing about abnormal cases; And even the model is different from the resource we are provided.  Say, we ought to get a WORD LIST and then find co-occurance from a bunch of document.  That needs a time complexity of O(N^2). Instead, we didn't have that list, and what we need to do is iterating the whole text, which made the complexity O(N).
