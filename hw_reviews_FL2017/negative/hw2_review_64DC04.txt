The Problem 2 and 3 are very important and reveals the procedure of a typical MapReduce. Gernally, I like them.
However, the Problem 1 is such a boring work. The hadoop operation review is OK, but when you tried to finish the sketch and diagram: it takes you forever to get a decent representation.
Indeed, the Problem 1 ruins my night due to its boredom.
