I feel the first question, i.e., Problem1, is little annoying. Especially for the second problem, i.e., the wikipedia article one. The question seems not very clear. Specifically, I'm not sure what the object is, whether it's wikipedia articals as a whole, or a specific article. So I tried to answer in both ways, and hopefully this can give me a good mark. 
Also, the compounds question seems require some chemical knowledge, and the knowledge is not shallow. As I'm not good at chemics, it causes some trouble for me. 
For Problem2, again it's not very clear, especially for the definition of same. In the problem 'same' is said several times, however, for sentences like "they will meet in the same hotel", I'm not sure about whether they must meet in the same hotel for all d days, or they just need to get together whatever the hotel. Still I tried both, as there are justification below (which is really good), I then understand the meaning.
For Problem3, I really don't like the artical as well as the question. The artical talks all about translation, and it uses several terminologies. Unfortunately I have no knowledge about them at all. Also, it seems that in order to read this artical you need some basic understanding about machine learning, which I think is not a very good requirement, especially after the first week of the course.
