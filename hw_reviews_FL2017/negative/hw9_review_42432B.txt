This time, I worked with a partner as the homework was substantially longer than normal. It helps that we were given an extra week, but with the midterm and keeping up with other exams, each problem definitely took longer than normal. That’s normal, I guess, since there are more parts. In particular, I would say that problem 2 was rather tedious and I saw no real value from doing the steps and stages, but I could follow matrix math pretty easily. In all, this was a longer, less interesting hw compared to the other assignments we’v done.
