This homework was again stressful because I procrastinated. I liked the Jaccard similarity and other similarity calculations, there was some straight math calculations for a change as opposed to conceptual problems or programming mapreduce functions which we actually did once in this homework. I'm also enjoyed learning the new input split practice where a file can be read in directly as a key value pair. It made the job in problem 1 much easier.
