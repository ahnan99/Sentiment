For homework 3, almost every question has been dealt with on the course. But i just have confused about the question 1b, it says that we can find the answer through lab0 and cheet-sheet. But i think that the question need us check the total lines from files in the hadoop directly. But for lab0, there is no access about how to check file in hadoop, so is that means wo should download the file from hadoop to local client first then check the lines of it?
