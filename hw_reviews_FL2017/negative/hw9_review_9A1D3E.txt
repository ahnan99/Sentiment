This homework assignment was pretty long, though we did have an extra week to do it. I found problem one to be fairly straight forward. Problem 2 was probably the most difficult and took by far the longest amount of time. Problem 3 was a simple implementation similar to the previous assignment, just changing the file extension from html to jpg. Problems 4 and 5 felt like the same problem, and were also easy to do after having worked on the lab since the tasks needed to be accomplished were similar.
