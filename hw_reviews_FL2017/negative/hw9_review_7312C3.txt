I thought this homework assignment was extremely challenging and believe that the unclear instructions made it much more difficult to complete. Problems 1 and 2 could have been more explicit on what the SPARK program was to do. Even though problem 2 was very lax in how to implement the solution it would have been better to have a more explicit guideline on how to solve it. Problem 3 was confusing in the wording of the instructions. Should we count each file individually or the total count of the entire directory?
