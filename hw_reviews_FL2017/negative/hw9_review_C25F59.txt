This homework is a very large work. i spend the whole weekland on it. i have confused about the first question for problem 4. it require me to describe generate sample dataset using pig or not. i don't know what is sample dataset. is it the toy test data or is the final data being dealt with by pig or mapreduce? i consider it as the final data. if it is just the toy test data, i don't know how to generate it using pig. for problem 4 , it always occur an error that i can't order the group. i using order xx by $1, do i have another choice to sort the group?
