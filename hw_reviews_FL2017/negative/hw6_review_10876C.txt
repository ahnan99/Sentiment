This homework was somewhat complicated in that we had to implement two different jobs, which means two mappers, two reducers, and two drivers. It was very confusing when trying to match the types of the key and value outputs for the mappers and reducers. At first try, I didn't get this correct and took some time to debug. Once the implementation was done and I had the whole output for the whole dataset, answering the questions to the homework was not too bad.
