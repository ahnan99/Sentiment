It causes troubles for distributed cache implementation, which is really annoying. 
Also, I don't think we have enough materials for distributed cache on slides, and it's really frustrating. 
Worsely, the link on the slides has certain formats and can't be copied directly. 
Hope we could have a more flexible schedule and deadline for the course.
