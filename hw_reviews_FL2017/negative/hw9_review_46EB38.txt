I thought this homework was particularly long, especially considering we didn't really get any extra time to work on it, since the remaining time was spent studying for the exam. We ran into some trouble with writing down pseudo-code for the SPARK matrix vector multiplication program, and we also found probably 4 to be particularly difficult to implement. I did like that problem one focused on the book problems, as I thought that those problems were a good extension of the material that we had learnt in class.
