This homework was little bit hard in that we had to analyze all the process of Hadoop Mapreduce job execution. It was a good opportunity to get to know different types of daemons and processes that run on master and worker nodes. Also, I was mostly interested in studying skew in times of various reduce functions and how difference in numbers of nodes or tasks could affect the skew. It was pretty hard but greatly helpful in that I could be more familiar with the concepts of skew and other reduce or map functions. Describing all the process of Hadoop Yarn job execution was pretty hard but helped me understand the material thoroughly.
