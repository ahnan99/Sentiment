This homework is extremely challenging and complex. It encompasses pagerank theory, matrix-vector multiplication implementation in Spark, Spark job excution details, and Pig usage. Using scala for the Spark program added more complexity than using python. Students are examined across a number of data processing techniques, so doing this homework is also incredibly rewarding. But more instructions on how to write code in scala or pig were expected before digging into this homework.
