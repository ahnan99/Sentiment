I found thiw homework to be frustrating. I ended up getting stuck a lot, and sometimes it was for obvious things. Other times I'd get stuck on syntax or not so obvious things. I ended up running out of time despite the extra time allotted for this homework. I probably spent more time on this homework than any other assignment. Overall, I found it to be very frustrating.
