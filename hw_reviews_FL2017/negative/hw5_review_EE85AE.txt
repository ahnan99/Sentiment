It seems that this homework is far easier than previous one and we assumed we
 could finish it in couples of hours. But when we implemented our thoughts to 
fulfil assignment requirements, many practical problems arise. For example, in
 problem 1, we originally planned to split IP address with other words using 
non-character sign “ - - “, but the output is not exactly what it’s supposed 
to be. Because log records is a huge file and contains semi-structured data, 
so format of all the records is not totally consistent with each other. Some 
of them are split by “ – “. Therefore, our strategy failed to get the right 
information. This is, big data is harder to handle than we expected.
