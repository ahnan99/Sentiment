I thought the homework set was challenging but was still quite doable. I enjoyed working on Problem 2 the most mainly because it was the most challenging and provided a kind of problem that I have not encountered before. I thought Problem 1 was vague in its directions and it was confusing to follow. One of the examples is very vague. I thought Problem 3 was simple because it was regurgitating what we read in the article. However, I thought the article was very informative and a great introduction into analyzing big data.
