I feel like this homework assignment was relatively straightforward. All of the needed information was in the slides, so I guess I felt confident about those answers. It all seemed somewhat relevant, though I wish we could actually do stuff instead of just talking about how it all works on a high level. It would be nice to be able to interact with an actual Hadoop cluster in a way that makes it so all of this content actually matters, as opposed to just memorizing information about Hadoop.
