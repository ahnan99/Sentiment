There is absolutely low coding load in this homework. So it
 should have been an easy assignment and finished in Probably 
one or two hours, which turned out to be wrong. I spent several
 hours going through text book and lecture slides and building 
a detailed and accurate understanding on processes and terms 
mentioned in three problems. But all in all, that is a good 
thing since I will never know if I truly make it clear what 
we learn in class.
