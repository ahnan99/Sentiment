for this homework, i have confused about the co-occurence word, i only have the way to sepearte the word using block space to keep all the non-word character in the word, the i delete all that part for each word. but if i do like that , the form of the word has been changed, for a word "anti-social",if i use the way i mentioned before, it should like "antisocial", without the "-",how can i pick up all co-occurence words correctly and still keep them the same as before?
