In this homework, we were able to implement the inverted index mapper and reducer. Overall, the implementation was straightforward. We were able to successfully complete the code. The only difficulty was to figure out the input format, as there were not enough examples in the slides. Also creating test input was tricky. It turned out that our program did not run because the format of the test was not correct. It would save us a lot of time if we knew that earlier.
