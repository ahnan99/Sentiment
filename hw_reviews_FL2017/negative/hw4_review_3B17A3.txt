For this homework, i spend lots of time to read the slides. I still confused about when i run the job locally, i need to put in the path of the files to my java code, otherwise, i can't find the txt file even it in my job running folder. And i still don't know how to run the jar file locally using command line. when i obtain the lab3, it always return to me that the roote is illegal. In details, the -fs= can't be distinguished by the command line. I also want to know how to change the name of the reducer in my java file. Is this possible?
