This homework was quite long. I did part of problem 1 and 2 before the midterm but got sick during the weekend so couldn't devote much time to study, and got a C on the midterm (sad, but i'm the only one to blame). The Pig assignment was interesting since I did not have experience with SQL. I really really really enjoy working with spark and think it's a useful tool to have in my arsenal. all in all pretty good. need to do hwM so that I can replace my shitty hw grade with that one.
