In this homework, we practiced some spark operations. It was a little confusing as to the differences between map and flatMap. It would be helpful if there were more examples presented in class to show how to use different transformations. Also, in the error messages, there were terms that we did not know their difinitions. It took some time to figure out that the error was, and how to fix them. Overall, the homework was a good exercise to get us familiar with spark.
