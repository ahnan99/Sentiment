This homework is not that hard to complete, but i confused that for the last question, why we use the cosine similarity to compute the similarity of movies pairs. Because for the movie5, only one user gave grade on it, so for movie5, the other movie with it only have two condition similarities, 1 or 0. We can't judge anything fromn that kind of data. Is that means if the numberof users are too small, the item-item similarity is not as good as user-user similarity? Just if we use normalized cosine similarity, the result will not change any more.
