I don't really like this homework, as for me it is boring. I feel the only thing I do is uploading data, or typying some boring script lines. Really don't like it. It's not bad to have a shorter homeword one week before the midterm, but I still think this homework boring. Maybe it's better to put it into a lab or studio section. Overall, pretty boring homework, especially for problem 1 and problem 2.
