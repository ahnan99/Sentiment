I thought this homework was particularly difficult. I didn't mind problem 1 or 3 but i thought that problem 2 was a little out of my range of knowledge considering what I've learned in class. I was a little confused about what problem 2 was asking us to do, but eventually we figured it out after doing some research. Overall, I feel as though the homeworks have been getting significantly harder.
