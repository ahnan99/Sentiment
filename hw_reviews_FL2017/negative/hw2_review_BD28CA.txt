Homework 2 requires us have a detailed realization of Hadoop Distributed Filesystem(HDFS): how are the data files 
stored in data nodes, how to extract required information and more importantly, how does MapReduce tasks work.
All above are essential to followed studies. But there is a thing:  most of questions in problem are based on the 
lecture materials which, I think, should be answered base on the insights of lecture slides and textbook. So it would 
be better if there are more open questions where we can share our thoughts.
