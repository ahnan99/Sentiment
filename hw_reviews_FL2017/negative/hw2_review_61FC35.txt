My description for Homework 2 starts with the “Getting Started,” “Indicating Group Work,” and “Submission Instructions” sections. Because they have appeared on both homeworks so far (and I anticipate they will be included on every homework assignment) these sections evoke an air of disinterest. On this particular homework, I think most of the questions were positive in nature, with the exception of one. There was a question within the first problem asking the student to sketch out a diagram. As I have been writing my homework solutions in Latex, this particular question caused me some feeling of frustration because I was forced to draw a picture on some separate medium or program whether it was just pen and paper or another computer application, and then figure out how to convert it to a pdf and submit it with the rest of my homework.
