This lab was very interesting in that we got familiar with the computation for similarities between items and coming up with collaborative filtering which was quite vague from the start and lectures, but ended up as a very useful tool after I thoroughly understand the concept and implement during hte homework. I was quite surprised with the fact that different algorithms associated with MapReduce process could be used for collaborative filtering. Implementation of the code for index inverting was a bit hard but after we finished implementation, it was easy to comprehend the concept and had some confidence in implementing this kind of new concepts in programming. I was impressed by this homework and was really thankful for the chance to understand the concepts we learned through the lectures. The problems in homework were deeply related to the concepts we have in the slides and the contents in the slides were very useful to solving this assignment. Thank you
