This particular homework left me feeling pretty frustrated. I have been trying to fight back from being behind in some of my classes and this one is no exception. I was attempting to finish late last night but fell asleep and only had a little bit of time to try to finish it up today. I am enjoyed the subject matter of this homework, but I ran into too many problems to end on a good note. SVN was giving me issues so I had to meet with somebody in Engineering services to figure out my problem, another unneeded delay.
