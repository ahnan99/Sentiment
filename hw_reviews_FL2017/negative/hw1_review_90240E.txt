This homework was really helpful for me to review and fully understand the contents we have learned from lecture. Analysis of Big Data properties helped me to get familiar with various properties of Big Data such as infinity, structure, and complexity that I was confused during the lecture. Analysis on my own gave me more intuition on understanding confusing concepts regarding Big Data. Mathematical problem was quite time consuming, but I personally think this problem is really interesting and helpful. Also, last problem which was based on the article made me more focused on the supplemental readings for the class. I felt like my knowledge was more broadened and improved in Big Data. One thing I was happiest about was that all the problems were coming from lecture, readings, and other supplemental sources. I hope other homework to be similar format to this one. I really enjoyed this homework.
