I found that problem 1 was really open-ended and a lot is left for the interpretation of the student. I am hopeful that I explained my interpretation with sufficient detail. Problem 2 I found to be challenging. It has been a long time since I have applied statistics in this way. The principal itself is very useful, but I found the equation to be complex. For Problem 3, I enjoyed the article and I believe it shows how the volume and variety of data can be just as or more powerfule than having complex anlaytical algorithms.
