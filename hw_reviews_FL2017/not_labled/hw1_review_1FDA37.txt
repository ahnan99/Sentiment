This homework was slightly confusing and had some difficult parts. I felt a little confused as to exactly how much was expected in my describing the data sets. This also felt pretty subjective which is not something I'm used to in computer science classes. The second problem was difficult, I had to go to the TA for that. It made sense once I figured it out but there were several tricky parts of finding a general formula that were confusing for me.
