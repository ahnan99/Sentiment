I thought this homework was much more reasonable. Most of the problems I felt well prepared to answer and had already learned material related to them. Compared to the last homework, I think this homework more fairly asked us to implement the ideas and concepts we had already studied a bit in class instead of asking us brand new material that we had never heard of before. Most of the challenging problems also had textbook pages attached to them to give us hints and further guidance.
