This homework was fairly similar to the material we have learned in class and helped me to reinforce the things that I've been learning this week. It was helpful to have incentive to look back at the slides and the reading and reinforce the things I've been learning. I liked this homework as well because it was a nice balance of coding and conceptual problems.
