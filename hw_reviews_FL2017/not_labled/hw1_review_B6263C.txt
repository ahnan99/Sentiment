The homework was more theoritical than I thought it will be. Problem 3 was especially lot more theoritical. I was expecting it to be more of introductory questions. Overall I was bit disappointed with the homework this time. Hopefully it will get better going forward. There was very less to do with the textbooks content in this homework which was unexpected to me.
