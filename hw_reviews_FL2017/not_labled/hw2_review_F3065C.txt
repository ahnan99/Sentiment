This homework was also a little confusing. I think for me its kind of strange to do a computer science homework where I am not coding. For this reason I was little uncertain about whether my answers were right or not. I felt confident once I checked in with the TA. I felt like the homework was good for understanding the material we have done so far, however I kind of wished we had done some coding in this homework.
