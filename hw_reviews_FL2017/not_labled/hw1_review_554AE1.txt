I honestly really didn't like this homework. The questions were either very easy or extremely difficult. The first question was very monotonous and required a lot of work for very simple work. I thought the second question was unfair, because we haven't learned or been provided any materials on ways or methods to solve this type of problem. Therefore, I have no idea how to approach it. Finally, I thought the article used for the third question was rather dumb and abstract, so it was hard to synthesize information from it.
