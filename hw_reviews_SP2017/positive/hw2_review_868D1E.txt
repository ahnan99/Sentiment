The second homework is mainly about the map reduce.
The first problem is easy, but it took some time to fully understand every question, since some of them are unclear to me.
The second and third problem are about the concept of map reduce, which seem to be quite easy for us as long as we know about it.
The last problem is about running a MapReduce job on VM, and it did take some time to be done.
Every question for this homework is not complex to me.
