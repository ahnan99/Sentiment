In this homework I feel like there are a lot of math problems. Although the concepts and calculations could really help us understand what actually happens behind the scene of a mapreduce job, I think throwing in an actual implementation of the matrix multiplication would help us even more. However, overall I’m pretty satisfied with the homework in terms of difficulty or workload. I’m also glad that we do not get homework for the future two weeks.
