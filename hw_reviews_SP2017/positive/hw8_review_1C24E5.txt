In this homework, we using mapReduce to deal with a real problem: Recommendation system. It is quite fun when implementing something to cope with the practical problem. However, I though that the mapReduce become more and more complex since in mapper and reducer, only key-value pairs can be accepted, so for complex data, we need to store more data in key or value and this make the procedure more difficult to read and understand.
