In homework number seven, we did some matrix multiplication. The homework is actually really helpful for me to get to know all the stuff I need to know in class. Moreover, it explains about how to use proper techniques that utilize the matrix multiplication, which includes taxation and other stuff. I like to do this homework because I may or may not benefit from doing it. The coding part of this homework is easy, so this homework is like more conceptual.
