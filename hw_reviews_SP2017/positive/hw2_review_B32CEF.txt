This assignment basically let us review the materials from lab1 and lab2 and the concept of MapReduce. I think it is helpful since I did not get a clear idea of how distributed file system works in class, but after this assignment I got better understanding of it. MapReduce is a complex process to implement, and I think what is covered in this homework about MapReduce is a good introduction for us to learn and do the following assignment.
