I think this homework is more straight-forward than the first homework. Partly because there are a lot less open-ended questions in the second homework, and partly because the problems are more specific in details and give out examples to illustrate what it is really asking for. I’m happy about how the homework turned out and will sure look forward to more homework like this in the future.
