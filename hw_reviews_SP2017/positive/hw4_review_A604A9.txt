This homework is like a review for past labs and homework. We are supposed to review the lab instructions and homework solutions if we are not very proficient in dooing things with command line. The implementation part is like a immitation part, because all we are supposed to do have been done in class. Code can be found on slides and lab instructions, but still it is good to have some hands on experience with real jobs. This homework took me 5 hours, and I think it helped me to learn something.
