    When I do Q1, it reminds me of the knowledge in the class. However, I feel uncertainty of every choice. I think Q2 is reasonable. I can get the probability through the calculation of the amount of combination and probability to choose one situation. Finally, when I am doing the last question, I am also not so sure whether I understand the meaning correctly or not.
