This is the first homework for CSE 427 class. Overall speaking, the completion process was okay, and I didn't spend too much time on this one(through split into two days for completion). For problem 1, which is primarily an extension of lecture slides, I completed that problem smoothly and quickly. Problem 2 was a little bit tricky, so I had to go over it again and again. Problem 3 was like a piece of something and needed you to actually read every word of that article and try to understand the deeper meaning and reference of each term. Completing problem 3 was a bit of annoying. Yet in the end I got three problems done before Wednesday, which was even better than I thought.
