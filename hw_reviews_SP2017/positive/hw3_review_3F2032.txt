The first and second problems are very good ones. They go through related problems and procedures of MapReduce job execution. I encountered a type mismatch error while testing the last problem, and have to go back to the previous slides and find the solution. I like this kind of problem because you need an overall understanding of the course material but not just recent chapters.
