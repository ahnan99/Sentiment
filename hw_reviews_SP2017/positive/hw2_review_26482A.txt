This homework was a little bit better than the last homework, but i still found this homework to be too easy. There was not much critical thinking in terms of making map reduce programs. I would have liked to be challenged more as i do not feel i am learning a ton from these two assignments. I am understanding the material but would like little more practicality/ coding practice.
