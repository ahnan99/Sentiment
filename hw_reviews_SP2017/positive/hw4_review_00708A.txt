I was really stressed about this homework because of another class that is taking up way too much time. But, the homework itself was useful and I feel like I am catching my basic mistakes earlier. This is also the first time I am using the extension, for which I am very grateful - thank you for having such a forgiving late policy. Overall, I feel good about this homework, and would enjoy this class a lot more if my other class wasn't making me so miserable.
