This is the first homework of cse427s and I worked with my partner for all of the three problems. It was quite fun to collaborate with others. We have many different opinions in problem 1, since the problems seems do not have unique answer. We shared our own ideas and discussed a lot of things. In addition, I like problem 2, since it is very interesting.
