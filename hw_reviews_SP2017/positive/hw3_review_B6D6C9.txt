This homework was fairly satisfying. After getting help to understand what "skew" is, I feel like I actually understand the concept. Problem 2 was helpful to review how job execution works, though I am perhaps still a little confused on some of the details. Problem 3 was actually really fun, because we finally got to apply what we have learned to write an actual (very simple) program. It also sorted out some confusion I had on navigating the local file system vs Hadoop in terminal, so that was helpful. It finally feels like we have the building blocks needed to accomplish things with MapReduce!
