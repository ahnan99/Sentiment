This homework is more difficult than the last one, we need to actually do some sort of research before we get an proper answer, especially the last problem. I read about the shortcuts and command line cheatsheet and didnâ€™t find an answer of how to search for certain pattern in a text file. However, I pressed h to view the helper inside the terminal, the I knew how to search with /pattern. Also, pressing n or N can do previous search in different directions, which can lead to different searching results. I learned something new, I feel progressing.
