The only question with this homework is the second question in problem 1. The skewness is measured, but not quantitatively. I believe the professor should elaborate the skewness in reduce() tasks, and I think we need to have the solution to this one. The Problem 1 and 2 are pretty straight forward, and anyone who has followed the lab instructions can figure those out easily. I strongly recommend the professor to explain about the skewness question in detail in class.
