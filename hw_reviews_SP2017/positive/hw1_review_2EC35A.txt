Problem 2:
This problem is an extension from evil-doers example from textbook. It is not too hard but still quite helpful. I feel appreciated that the problem provides a hint of possible outcome, which saves me a lot of time. My attitude towards this is positive;

Problem 3:
I don't like this problem. The paper is hard to read, and seems have not too much connection with questions. I feel struggled when I try to find the answer and get lost eventually. I think it is negative.
