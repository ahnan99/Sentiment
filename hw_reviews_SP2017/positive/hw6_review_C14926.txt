This is a very good homework assignment. The first problem is related to the custom WritableComparable, which will lead to a better understanding to create and handle the user-defined Writable types. The second problem is complicated but valuable, using SequenceFiles (with and without compression) to make students more familiar with different kinds of storage of data. The third problem is inverted index, a fairly comprehensive problem about designing Mapper and Reducer. All problems are satisfactorily comprehensive.
