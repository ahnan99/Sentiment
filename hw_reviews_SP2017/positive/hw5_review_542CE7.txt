Problem 1 is mainly about using combiner. Implementing combiner is similar to Reducer, and I can even use reducer function directly. The last two question of this problem show us how to use TARN Resource Manager Web UI to monitor our MapReduce task, and use data to indicate how combiner works. And the second problem helps me understand how distributed cache and partitioner works in HDFS.
