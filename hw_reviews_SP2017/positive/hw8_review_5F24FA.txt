This homework asked us to implement a mapreduce job from scratch in problem (a) of the first problem. It requires tons of works, but after that all the following problems are much easier. Personally I enjoyed the problems like problem 1(a), and it also helped me practice basic java programming. I think it¡¯s a good idea for homework to include both practical part and theoretic part.
