This homework is about the concepts of HDFS and MapReduce. The first problem asks us to sketch the data storage on HDFS and describe the meta data, which helps me better understanding the concept of data locality. The second and third problems are related to MapReduce, which clarify the functions of mapper and reducer. The last one is based on some hand-on experience of running a MapReduce job. I believe it¡¯s valuable for engineering students.
