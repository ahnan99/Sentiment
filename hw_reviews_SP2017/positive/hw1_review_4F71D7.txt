When I first saw my homework 1, I thought there are only 3 problems and it should be some kind of easy. However, when I started to write it, the problem came out.The first problem in the homework one does not have a exactly correct answer, so I discussed a lot with my partner and for half an hour we finally came to the result. We did the same step with problem 2 and problem 3.I think the problems are a little bit difficult, but when I finally finished it, I realized that I get much more familiar with these concepts. I think this is the only but big good thing.
