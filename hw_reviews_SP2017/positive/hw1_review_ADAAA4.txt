This homework is rather easy, in term of negative or positive, I feel positive about this homework. The part of properties of different datasets is useful to make sure I understand
Concepts like amount, size, infinity etc. I hope I didnâ€™t write too much for problem 1. Problem two is too similar to what is written in the book, and I got a clear understanding of how large volume data would give us wrong outcomes through analysis, because huge number of data makes more random events. This taught a valuable lesson before learning data mining and big data, because trusting data too much may be fooled by data itself.
