This one took me longer than last one. The question about what signatures are in the data confused me. Do you want to know about what each part of the data stands for? Or do you want to know what type of data is actually in the data file? This is actually the fuzzy part. The programming and debugging required by this homework is fine, which means that it is not as challenging as the last homework. I guess the problem 1 and problem 2 are more difficult than the last one, but I actually get to learn something via doing them.
