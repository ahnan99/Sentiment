I found homework 9 to be pretty enjoyable.  I prefer using Python, so it was nice to be able to implement (at least part of) the homework in pyspark. Otherwise, PIG is a bit repetitive and can seem tedious, but also I can see how it's really useful and I'm happy to start adding it to my repetoire of CS skills. I also liked that this week was a "project for Dualcore" -- it tied the class material into relevant real-life applications. Overall, homework 9 might have been my favorite homework assignment yet. We'll see; I still have some left to do.
