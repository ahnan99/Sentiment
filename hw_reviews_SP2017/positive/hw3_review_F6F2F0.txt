This homework is very comprehensive, with more practices in programming and more basic explanations of Hadoop MapReduce. The first problem is related to basic statistics, which makes students think more about the efficiency of MapReduce. The second problem is explanation related to YARN, which makes student understand more of the process of job execution. The third problem is very nice with practices, and I hope that more programming assignments will be given in the future. Also, it would be nice if students could have more data sets to practice with the MapReduce jobs, not limited to word count program. In sum, this is a very good homework assignment with comprehensive questions to be answered.
