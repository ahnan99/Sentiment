I think this homework is quite helpful. For Problem 1 and 2, although they are quite fundemental concepts, they strengthen my understanding. Although reading materials is quite painful and time-consuming, it helps a lot. Problem 3 is a coding problem, I find it quite useful and interesting to do. Although I am not good at writing Java, the fiven Java files have already included package and class, making it much easier to focus on algorithm. In sum, I have a postive attitude toward hw 3.
