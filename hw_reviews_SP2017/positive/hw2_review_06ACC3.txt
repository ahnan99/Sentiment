The first problem of this homework is about the structure of HDFS. (a) and (b) review the hadoop commands. (c) review the structure for the data stored in clusters and the use of name node and master node. Problem 2 is about Mapreduce process. It is not difficult once we understand the purpose of each step. Next problem is similar to problem 2. For the last problem, we look up some material from internet, and have a deeper understanding for mapreduce process.
