This is a very good homework assignment. It mainly focuses on Pig and Spark programs, which are very good practices for students to get familiar with them. The first three problems are based on Pig data analysis and manipulation. Pig Latin is a language very similar with SQL. These problems are not complicated, but good enough to make students more familiar with the functionality and basic programming concepts of Pig. The last two questions focus on Spark, which is more powerful and comprehensive. Overall, all the five problems are valuable practices.
