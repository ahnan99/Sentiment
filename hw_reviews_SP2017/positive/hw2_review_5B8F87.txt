We struggled during this homework because it is not a very pleasant work. Some
of the words in the homework appear to be vague so I went to the office hour
seeking for assistence. Luckily the teacher assistent taught me a lot about
how to finish this homework, and that helped a lot. I'm writing this review
because I need to write it and it should be longer than 50 words. Great job,
Wilson. That should be about fifty words now.
