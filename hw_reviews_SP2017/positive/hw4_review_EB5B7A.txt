This is the forth homework now and I am still writing the review. When I first received homework 4, I found that it contained 2 problems and the first one was toolrunner, the second one was question about test. I have learnt in class so this was pretty easy for me. Although it was easy, I still got several questions, so I went to TA asked the questions and all solved in an afternoon. I feel relieved.
