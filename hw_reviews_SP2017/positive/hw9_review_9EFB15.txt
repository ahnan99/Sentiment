In this homework, we are using pig and spark to analyze data. Since these tools are higher level than MapReduce and have interactive shell as well as higher abstraction, I find they are more convenient than MapReduce when analyzing data. But I am not very familiar with Python, so I need more time to study how to write a spark program. However, it is worth to learning a useful and powerful tool.
