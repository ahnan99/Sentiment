This is the 6th homework so far. I did the first and the second problems. Not easy for me. I looked up on website and referred some books then finally I have done the job. Quite confident of this. I hope that every next homework will be handful and the exam will not be that hard. I turned the homework not that early, so the 7th homework has already out, I hope it would not hard for me.
