During our work in homework 6, we endeavored to complete customizing the writable, manipulation on sequence files and Snappy, along with inverted indexing on words. The problem set help us to review the content in lecture correspondingly, and is with right difficulty, but the workload of the problem is a bit more than enough. Also, in problem 3, it took a long time for the job to be completed, though it is necessary to teach us how cloud computing really works and the problem doesnâ€™t require us to submit the job, it will be helpful if we can get a early warning on the time consumption.
