Homework 5 is a good way for us to have a comprehensive understanding of the debug methods and the fully utilization of hadoop. By completing the homework, I integrated my knowledge about hadoop system. And also, the difficulty of this task is at the right level, such that we need to think about it and it covers what we’ve learnt. And the there’s no ambiguousness in this homework. So I think I will prefer this homework to the other ones.
