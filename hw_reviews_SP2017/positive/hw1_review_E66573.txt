I thought this was an interesting homework assignment. I really enjoyed questions 1 and 2, but problem 3 was a bit vague in my opinion, and the information needed wasn't fully covered in the article. I like the problem-based questions, where we have to think about the concepts learned in class and apply them to questions at home.
