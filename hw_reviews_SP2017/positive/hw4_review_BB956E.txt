I found this homework assignment quite enjoyable. I prefer implementing classes and programs in Java to answering questions about an article/textbook chapter.  This homework has been my favorite so far, because it involved more than just following the directions--I welcomed the challenge of passing a parameter to the AvgWordLength class that I wrote for last week's homework and writing a new MR program for the weblog file. I didn't love the last few parts of problem 2, because I was confused on what the questions were asking.
