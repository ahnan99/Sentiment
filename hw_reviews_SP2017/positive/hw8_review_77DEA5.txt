Problem 1 is about implementing Top-N-List for recommend system and it helps me understand how to implement multiply MapReduce job in a single driver. In this problem, I use lots of knowledge learned before, like distributed cache. For part b of this problem, the result from R gets me a hint that dealing with SQL data, it is better and more efficient to preprocess the data first. Problem 2 is more theoretic, it let me think about the difference and similarity between different similarity measurements. For the last problem, it compares item-item approach with user-user approach.
