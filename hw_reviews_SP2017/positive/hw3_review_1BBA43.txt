This homework was a little bit tricky since the requirement was updated several times, so I had to revise result from time to time. Overall speaking the homework was fine. Most of parts were coming from out previous lab #3 or reading, so I got familiar with concepts quickly. The write-up part of mapper, reducer and driver was a little bit tricky and I did spend some time configuring and playing with Hadoop. It was so fun just playing around and trying Hadoop! I like playing around with Eclipse, Hadoop and MapReduce.
