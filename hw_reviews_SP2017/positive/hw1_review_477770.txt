    I worked on this homework with my partner. For problem one, we need to analyze properties of big data. 
Discussing and exchanging thoughts is a good way to solve this problem. Although we had different thoughts
on some aspects and may both be confused of some questions, we thought over a lot and understood each property 
more thoroughly. For problem two, I followed the instructions on the textbook and made a mistake on computing 
days. It confused me a couple of hours and made me feel disappointed. Finally, I found out the mistake and got
the correct answer. I should try to solve it following my own train of thought rather than just refer to textbook.
For problem three, it is hard to summarize a concept from a long paper and I read it carefully two times before I
can find out the clues. It is still difficult for me to extract information from a paper. I hope I can make progress. 
    This is not a difficult homework but it still asks for independent and through thinking.
