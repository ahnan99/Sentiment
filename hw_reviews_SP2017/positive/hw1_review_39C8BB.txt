As a student who have literally no programming background, I feel under great pressure. However, this first homework is not about programming, but requires a lot of reading and thinking. The reading material is too hard to understand and it took me almost two days to finish the reading and answering questions. The second problem is interesting for me since i'm a math major in college. I hope to have more questions like this in future homework.
