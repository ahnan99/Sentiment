I really enjoyed actually executing a MapReduce file (albeit) with a good amountof guidance and getting working results. It was pretty satisfying to finish problem 3. I definitely thought problems 1 and 2 were quite dry though. I'm very much looking forward to future labs where we do more complex MapReduce tasks and do more implementation/writing code in Java. I imagine it will be some fun stuff and hopefully transferable to my job this summer.
