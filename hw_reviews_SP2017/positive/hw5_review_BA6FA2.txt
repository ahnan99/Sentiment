For the hw5, I have implement how to use combiner and partationer to make the MapReduce faster and can save memory. By comparing the outputs of the MapReduce using combiner and the MapReduce without using combiner, I find out that the combiner can save memory in process the Mapper, so if we wan to procsee tons of data, it is very important for us to use the combiner to save memory and make our processing faster.
