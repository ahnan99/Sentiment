This assignment was a good review for implementing what we learned in lecture. Although I liked the assignment in general, however, many parts seemed to be not intuitive. The test java file came with some errors and I had to chenge small bits of code to complete the assignment. Also, with the amount of imports I had to add, I was unsure if I was completing the assignment correctly.
