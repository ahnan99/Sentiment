i feel homework 2 is very fair in terms of difficulty. if you follow the professor Neumann and understand the concepts about Mapreduce procusdures, you can do well in homework and it will not take you so much time. If the professor keeps asking homework questions like this, i can expect I will learn a lot from this class.
