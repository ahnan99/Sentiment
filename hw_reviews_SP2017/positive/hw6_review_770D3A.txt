This homework was a challenge. It tested everything we went over in lecture but since we didnâ€™t have a lab on the material it took me a while to implement some of the code. I feel like I gained a better understanding of how compression/noncompression works after doing this assignment. Overall I enjoyed this assignment and was am very comfortable with the command line to run test on hfds while also debugging any errors that may come.
