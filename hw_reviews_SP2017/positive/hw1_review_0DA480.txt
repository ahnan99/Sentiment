I found the first problem very helpful and kind of interesting. The three examples differ quite a bit from each other, and that really helped me and my partner find out what concepts we were not very familiar with. The second problem was a little intimidating at first sight. The third problem felt like the longest because I'm not used to reading articles for a CS class.
