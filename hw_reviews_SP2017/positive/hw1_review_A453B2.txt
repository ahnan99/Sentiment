well, it is really interesting to do this experiment.
For this homework one, since this is our first written homework in this semester, i thought it may not be difficult. Actually it is easy as i expected! So i m glad to see that.
But with the time goes by, i believe the difficulty will become higher, and i have already been ready for that! Just come on!
