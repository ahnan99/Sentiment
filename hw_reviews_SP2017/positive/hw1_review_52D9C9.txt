Cloud computing is widely used in daily life, which makes this course so important for people even have different background. Since the assignment 1 is the first task I’ve got, actually I think this assignment is not that hard but interesting. The first question is just like a review of what we have done in class, other ones are enhancing basic understanding of the techniques. Generally speaking, I’m happy with the assignment.
