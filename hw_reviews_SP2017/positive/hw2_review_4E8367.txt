When I first headed the problems in homework2, I realized that if I finished doing lab1 and lab2 and if I listened carefully to the instructor in the class, it was not hard or even quite easy for me to finish this homework2. So I finally decided to do the homework by myself. And on the way I was doing my homework, I found it a little confused in problem 1 question 4 and problem 4, so I googled and finally got my answer. All the time I took finishing this homework is about 3 hours. I hope the following homework can be as easy as this one.
