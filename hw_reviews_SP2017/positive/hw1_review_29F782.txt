This homework is overall reasonable. It is not too hard. The content in it is covered within the material provided on the lecture, or those book and paper mentioned in the homework. One thing I have say is somehow, the paper it mentioned is a bit long, and may require more time for non-native speaker to read and understand. Also, for summery it requies a deep understanding and hard for grading.
