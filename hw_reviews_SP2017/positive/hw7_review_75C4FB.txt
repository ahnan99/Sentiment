For this homework, I have a lot of practice on the matrix compution, which gives me a deeper understanding of the matrix inner product and outter product. Also by think about the difference between the two different representation of the transition matrix, I developed my logic of trading off between the memory and efficiency. Thank you for the instructor and all the TAs' help. Thank you so much!
