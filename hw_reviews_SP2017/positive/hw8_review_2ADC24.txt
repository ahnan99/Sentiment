This lab is very interesting. I got to work long hours with Jason together and Marion assumes that we know some shitty math about matrix. Howevver, we managed to finish this homework at last. The code online was kinda helpful, but I ended up did not use it. Well, I need 50 words to get the extra credit, so here they are. 50 words. lol lol lol lol lol
