This hw 6 took too long a time for doing. The main reason is that there is few examples and slides didn't give enough hints. I think I don't have a good understanding of the contents and methods or concepts for these several slides. I feel it very hard to do such problems. I need to admit that it is a good choice of problem and really make you gain a lot but it is difficult actually. I get a positive feeling for that but still want to improve my efficiency on such things.
