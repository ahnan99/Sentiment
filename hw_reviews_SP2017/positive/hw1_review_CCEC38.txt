This homework is the first homework for Marion's cloud computing class. I have
to write this review because I need that 5% bonus points. This problem set
contains 3 problems, and it took me longer to finish than expected. I like it
when I can do the probability quiz as in the book and I dislike that long
essay I had t read. Hey I think I've written 50 words for now. Thanks for
reading.
