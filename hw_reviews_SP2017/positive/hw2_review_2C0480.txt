This homework was less stressful for several reasons. First, working with a partner helped; I have trouble focusing while working alone, so group work actually helps my productivity and efficiency. Second, I am getting better at LaTeX, so the actual writeup took less time. Third, the questions were less theoretical and more practical, and I thought provided a good review of what we covered in lectures and labs. I am still a little worried about how I am doing since we haven't gotten feedback from hw1 yet, but I definitely enjoyed this homework more than the first.
