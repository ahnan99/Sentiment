This is my third homework now for course cse427s, and I am quite confident with it because there are three questions, as long as I do it carefully, I can finish it. For the first question, we have to understand what and how MapReduce job works exactly, so if we totally understand it, this problem will be easy. Fir the second question, we read the hadoop book to get the answer as well as google search for the answer, and finally we get our own answer. For the last question, we just have to revise previous wordcount one to fit this one, so actually not that hard.
I hope this time I can get a good score!
