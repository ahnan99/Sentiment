This homework assignment caused me a little stress. Problem 1 took the longs time because I felt like it was a little confusing with the amount of material given. I had to do outside research to come up with the answer. I like how problem 3 gave me the opportunity to apply the skills learned in lecture to an assignment. This problem helped me further understand the concepts we have been reading about by applying it to a simulated data set. Overall this assignment was good.
