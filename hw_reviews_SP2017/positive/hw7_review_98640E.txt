For this problem set, the first problem is about using pair as key. So it only needs a small change that we can make the old version MapReduce work on this problem. In the second problem helps a lot on understanding how to implement MapReduce to do matrix-vector multiplication and the difference between strips and pairs. For the last problem, it helps to understand the time and space complexity for PageRank.
