This homework assignment is about running a real MapReduce job in java. As far as I am concerned, this homework is a combination of previous labs. Therefore with the solid memory of the previous contents, this homework would not be a hard one to finish; and it indeed does not has much difficulty in implementation. However, there are some challenging points in coding, such as the division of numbers using different datatypes.
