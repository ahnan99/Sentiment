In my opinion, homework 3 is also pretty straightforward. I and my partner took around 2.5 hours to finish the assignment. I like the coding assignment (problem 3) the most among the three problems. It is practical assignment and also help us deepen our understanding of the MapReduce process.  I hope there will be more problem in the next homework that will be similar to problem 3 in this homework.
