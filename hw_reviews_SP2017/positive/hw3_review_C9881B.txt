Homework 3 is a good way for us to refine our understanding of the excution process of the MapReduce algorithm, the average word length program has right difficulty for us, based on the word count program we've read. Also by going through problem 3, I deepened the understanding about how MapReduce programs are executed, and I realized the importance of effective debugging methods. However, for problem 2, the problem statement is ambiguous, which took extra time for us to guess what are the real point of the question.
