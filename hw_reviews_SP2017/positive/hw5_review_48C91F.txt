This is a very good homework assignment. The first problem is related to the Combiner, which will lead students to actually feel the advantages when using a combiner using statistics. The second problem is more comprehensive, to ask students to implement a Partitioner, which will test the skills of students to develop a effective program to read words from given files and store them, and finally use them to determine the partitions. Both problems are clear and comprehensive.
