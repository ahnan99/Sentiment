I thought homework 6 was a pretty fun assignment. Despite the fact that I had a busy week and a debilitating migraine for the majority of it--thus I ended up having to rush to get hw6 done at the last minute--it was an interesting challenge and I appreciated the task of implementing new types of mapreduce programs.  I especially enjoyed the inverted index question.  The sequence file was a bit more boring because it didn't involve very much problem solving.
