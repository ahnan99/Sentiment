I feel generally good about this homework. I spent approximately 2 hours to complete this homework. Problem 1 helped me review the data properties discussed in class. Problem 2 is very interesting, and I think it is trying to tell me something worthnoting but unrelated to this course itself. I feel happy after I verified my formula with the provided table. I also don't see a connection between problem 3 and course material.
