from this homework 3, I have a basic understanding of how to use java to implement the MapReduce. Because of the coding process, I went through the whole progress of the map function and reduce function. Meanwhile, I also got a clear insight towards the structure of the MapReduce process, such as where should the different data be stored, how many processes are there in different phases. I have learned a lot from this homework. Thank you so much for the instructor and all the TAs' help!
