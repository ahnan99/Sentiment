This homework 1 is not too difficult or easy. Question 1 is problem that we already done in class (P quiz). We have not seen or talk about things in problem 2 and 3 in class, but it becomes straightforward if we read the text book. I doesn’t took me a lot of time to do this homework. The style of question 3 is different from the normal compsci homework style, because we need to read and get the information from the article to answer the questions, the problem doesn’t have a lot of math involved.
