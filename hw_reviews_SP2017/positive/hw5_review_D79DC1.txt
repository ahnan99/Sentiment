This hw is more difficult than past homeworks. Although there are less problems in this homework, and less questions in one problem. However, this homeword took me more efforts than before. Lab instructions and examples on the slides are not that enough to guide us step by step. The partitionerTest.java file comes with bugs which we need to fix by ourselves. This homeword requires us to go thourgh past lab instructions and slides to be inspired of how to do the homework. Writing a test this time requires us to use assert equals. Also this time our job is to build a jar with almost all stuffs and command lines we learned before.
