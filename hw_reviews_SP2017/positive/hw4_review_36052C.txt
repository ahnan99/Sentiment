In homework 4 problem 2, we implement a MapReduce program of log hits count. In this problem, we implement ToolRunner, MRtest and run this program respectivly on local system, pseudo-distributed cluster first and check the results as well as thinking about whether the MapReduce program is ready for running on real Hadoop cluster or not. This is a complete procedure for building MapReduce program. However, we still not familiar with how to debug and I am expecting the course tomorrow.
