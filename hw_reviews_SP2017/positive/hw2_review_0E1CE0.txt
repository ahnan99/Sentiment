I thoroughly enjoyed this homework--more so than the first. Maybe it was because I worked with a partner, but I also found that this homework allowed me to more deeply understand the inner-workings of the HDFS structure as well as the MapReduce process. It was also quite cool to take a look at sentiment analysis, which I'm contributing to right now, and come up with two nice ways to improve quality/efficiency.
