This is a fair homework. The first question actually help us learn how to create a project from a fresh begining. However, I get some problem with that. So I think professor should give a tutorial on that at the first couple labs. It turns out that we have to import an external lib which is a bit hard for people like me who is not that familiar with ecilipse. The next couple questions are instructive. From that I learn deeper on the recommend system and how some of them works. It is helpful if we can do a project on this.
