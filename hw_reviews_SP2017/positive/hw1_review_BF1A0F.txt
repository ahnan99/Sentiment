I thought this homework was a good overview of the reading and extra materials. It provided a good synopsis of te slides as well, and provided decent questions to test the understanding. The question regarding probability seemed a bit irrelevant to the lectures, but was relatively easy to grasp. The summary questions for the article were a bit open ended, but I liked that it allowed us to provide a broader response so that it could test my understanding.
