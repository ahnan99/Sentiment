I like that in this homework we actually got to plan with real data: data from netflex. It is also very nice to implement the mapreduce job from scratch on our own. I think there should be more exercises like this in the future. I also like the fact that most of the structure of the code is given so that we have some framework to work with. I do like this homework and hopefully the last few homeworks can be as lightweight and helpful as this.
