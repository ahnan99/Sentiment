This one took me longer than last one. The question about what the flaws of word co method  confused me. Do you want to know about what each part of the data stands for? Or do you want to know what type of data is actually in the data file? This is actually the fuzzy part. The programming and debugging required by this homework is fine, which means that it is not as challenging as the last homework. I think this homework is theoretical and fun.
