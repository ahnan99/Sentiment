This homework set is worthy. Problem 1 helps me do some digging on how functions are assigned and processed in HDFS. My understanding for this process is more through. The second problem is about YARN. It also help me review the slides and data locality. The problem 3, coding part is thrilling, although is not hard. But it helps a lot on hadoop commands, and how Mapper and Reducer are connected.
