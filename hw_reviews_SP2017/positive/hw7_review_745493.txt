This homework was a bit challenging but fair. I was able to apply some of the concepts i learned in class to real problems thats not does not require me to write code. The coding portion of this homework allowed freedom of development as long as the problem is solved. This homework did not take long compared to homework in the past and my stress level was pretty low.
