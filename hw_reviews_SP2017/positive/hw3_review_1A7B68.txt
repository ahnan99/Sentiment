This was the first homework for this class for which we needed to write code. It was a bit stressful at first when we were just starting, because we were expecting the coding part to take several hours at least, like in other CS classes. As it turned out, however, it was not tedious at all and was kind of fun to know that we just wrote our first data analytics program. Other than that, the other two problems were just reviewing concepts that we've learned in class, so they were like, OK.
