The first problem helps me get familiar with UNIX commands and implement pig script. The second problem is similar with the first one, and I only need to modify a small part of the code from last problem to do the job. Problem 3 let me find a mistake I make on lab 5, when loading the data I should specify an alternate delimiter as an argument to PigStorage. Problem 4 and 5 is about Spark. They are also very helpful.
