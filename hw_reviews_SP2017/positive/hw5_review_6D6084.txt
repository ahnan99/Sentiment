This homework has 2 questions, not that hard so we finished our parts half day each. Especially the first question, I have taken the course on this so it was easy for us to finish. It was like only an hour to finished the first one and the second one was a little bit different so we spent a little more time to do this. We are doing to submit the homework and I hope that we can get a good result.
