This week’s assignment definitely helps me understand the class material better. Plus, I am really excited that we finally start coding.  I like coding in java. Therefore, I feel that question 3 is pretty interesting and I am also amazed at how fast it processing data. This week’s assignment really makes me understand how useful this course is.
