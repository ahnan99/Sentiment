For this homework, my partner and I cooperate perfectly. Since it is the end of the semester and there are so many stuffs, we divided the homework and worked on each part. Although there are some troubles during the process, we figured out the solution successfully and learned a lot. I am pretty sure I master most of the content in this course. I am proud of myself. I am ready to do the final project.
