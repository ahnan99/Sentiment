In homework four, my group member and I applied the tool to work on the nodes
and code. It is really helpful as it helps us adapting the tools available in
this module. Compared to no tools, it is really easier for me to configure my
files through command line if I am using the tools. A helpful assignment is
good, and can benefit me a lot. Generally, this assignment is helpful and
interesting.
