I liked this assignment because it, yet again, allowed us to test and implement an actual map reduce job. The process also reflected that of a reasonable job implementation flow, starting from testing locally eventually to submitting the actual job on the hdfs, Otherwise, I enjoyed the questions regarding the undersatanding of which methods are easier to run jobs locally, as well as why and how the records are sorted.
