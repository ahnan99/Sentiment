Homework 4 is overall interesting and somewhat challenging. It helps me solidify my understanding of ToolRunner and how configurations work in Hadoop as well as the difference between running a map reduce job locally and on a cluster. It is also a good exercise in Java code. However, some of the questions could have been worded better so as not to cause confusion, or provided a little bit more context as to what certain terms mean.
