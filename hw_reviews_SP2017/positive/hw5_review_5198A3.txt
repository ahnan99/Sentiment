This homework requires lots of time on coding, and it is not easy to find an example, so I feel very struggled about that. Although it is quite helpful, I still need to admit it takes too much time and effort. My VM cracks down and I spent hours on restoring it. Meanwhile there were bugs with the provided java and not easy to fix since it hides deeply. I gain a lot, yet suffered a lot. I would say it is both positive and negative about this home work 5 and I had rather say I feel a net positive about that.
