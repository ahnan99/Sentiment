I really enjoyed designing and implementing my own MapReduce job from scratch. It definitely reinforced the recommendation systems material we learned in lecture. I do wish it walked us through a few of the steps though, because it was pretty overwhelming to start with nothing. The last problem was a real pain because of having to keep track of whether the movie-id or user-id were the keys or values, since they would switch around depending on the job or whether it was a mapper or reducer.
