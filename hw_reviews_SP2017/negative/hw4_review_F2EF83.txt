I think this homework takes significantly longer than the previous ones as a weekly homework, although it could be just me not having a partner at all. I wish there could be a more even distribution of the homework throughout the semesters so that we have better expectations at the begining of the course. I do think the homework is particularly helpful for real-world applicaitons, considering the questions are very specific and practical. I wish the next homework could be broken into two if it is as long as this one.
