This first homework was longer than expected and quite tedious.  It required going back into the lecture notes and readings to extract and summarize information.  The probability problem took a while and ultimately, I don't think it was necessary to understand the concept.  Overall it wasn't the worst homework I have been assigned, but I also didn't enjoy it.
