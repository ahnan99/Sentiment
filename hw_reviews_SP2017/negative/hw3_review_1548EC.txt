I kind of have the same feeling for this homework as I did for the first homework. The questions are qualitative and the answers are supposed to be descriptive, leaving a lot of room for us. I don't typically like these types of questions since I feel it is easy to miss a few points here and there due to the vagueness of the questions. I do hope there would be more coding question in the future, which would actually prepare us for the real world tasks.
