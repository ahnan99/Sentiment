I got a big trouble doing this homework. My laptop black screen when the virtual machine is running, which broke the linux image and I have to install a new one. The problem 2 referred to setups in previous labs, so I have to redo the lab0 and lab1 for the homework. I don¡¯t like tasks based on previous ones. Despite the accident, this homework only consists of hand on practicing. I think it¡¯s better than giving theoretical problems.
