I think hw5 is a bit difficult especially with the Partitioner part. It was consufing at first because the code setup was a little bit off and the execution is sort of different from previous MapReduce java programs. But I still figured out a way to handle and debug it. I am not so sure about the "number of bytes read" count, as there are 2 counters for that - one for File, the other for HDFS. I only reported the File one though.
