This assignment was frustrating. I felt like we had to figure a lot of these things out ourselves, which I understand is supposed to be part of the learning experience, but there was very little guidance given in the lecture slides. Many of the things we had to implement, I had to seek help for on StackOverflow , like the SequenceFileWriter. The demo provided seemed a bit outdated, and a lot of modifications were made on my part to adapt the code to its intended purpose.
