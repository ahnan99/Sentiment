In this homework, we began to write java code for mapReduce and implemented an average word length mapReduce task. Although this is a very simple problem, but I also fell excited when I finished it, since this is a good starting. However, I am still fell uncomfortable in using eclipse in VM, the speed is very slow and I also do not like the font in VM. I am considering to finish the code in my local machine, but it will be hard to debug and test, so upset.
