This homework took much longer than the other homeworks.  There was a lot of setup involved, and it required looking back at previous labs and homeworks.  Looking back at previous assignments is a pain especially if you don't remember exactly which lab the information can be found in.  In the future it would be helpful to have more info directly in the hw, reminders and hints for example.  Overall I'd say the length was the biggest detriment to the homework.
