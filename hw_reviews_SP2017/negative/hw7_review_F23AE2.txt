I have done my homework7 problem 1 and 3 and following is the review. The write-up part, which is problem 3 is easy for me because after I read the MMDS section 5.1 and 5.2, the problem for me is easy to solve. But for problem 1, I debugged a lot of time and I with my partner debugged several times as well because we did not have any relative programing knowledge for co-occurrence except in class so we have to google a lot to find out, and this took some time.
