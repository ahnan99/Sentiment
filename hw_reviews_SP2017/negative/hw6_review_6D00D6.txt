This homework is the toughest homework assignment ever since. It not only requires participation and fully understanding in class, also demands ability in solving problems that have not been taught. Problem 2 part a and part c's output file are hard to be read, especially the third part. So I considered them as something wrong with my code. After I debuged for hours, I then found out that they are supposed to be like that. How frustrated am I!
