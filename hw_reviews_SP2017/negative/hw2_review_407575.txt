I understand the basic premise of sentiment analysis, but asking us to improve a word count program for sentiment analysis is another thing entirely. It would have helped if we were given more examples on how others have improved their analysis on sentiment in their algorithms. Overall, the homework this time was rather straightforward, if a bit confusing on what is required. For example, problem 3 part a: what do you mean by compute? Are we not just finding the info for our key-value pairs form the input data above?
