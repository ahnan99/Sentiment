Question number one on this homework was very lengthy and seemed uselessly redundant at times.
The next few questions were very conceptually based though and this was very helpful for my understanding.
The only drawback was question 3b since it required a huge amount of tedious work with brackets to an
extent that seemed like it may be unnessecary to really help and understand the material.
