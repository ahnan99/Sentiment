This homework is much more complicated than past homework. I think this homework should be given more instructions. For instance, for the first 2 questions, we don’t know if we are doing it correctly after doing it. I think this can be improved by following instructions. If it gives me the right output for the test input, we know that we are doing it with right code on the right dataset. But now, I feel very unsafe after doing this because I don’t know which may go wrong. For the problems 4 and 5,they are pretty straightforward.
