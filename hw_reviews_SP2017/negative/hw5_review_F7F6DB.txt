I had a very busy week so I wasn’t able to turn the homework in on time. It was really frustrating to realize that I couldn’t finish the homework as fast as I expected, and we had to work until Sunday morning to finalize our results. I wanted to improve on this when we turned in late last time. Next time we should definitely plan ahead and get started earlier.
