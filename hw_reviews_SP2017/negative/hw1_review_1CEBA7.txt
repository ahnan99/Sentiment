I was slightly unsure about question 1 for some of the dimensions, especially that of labels. It's unclear to me when exactly there might be an unexplained variable in the data but I tried my best to reason things out. Deriving the equation for Bonferroni's principle took me a little while to figure out but I eventually matched my answers with the few examples. I was definitely frustrated by the article "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" because I felt it was very verbose to the point that it made the article hard to read and understand. Answering the questions to the article was not easy for me.
