This assignment involved more of me figuring things out on my own than the other assignments did, so I didn’t enjoy it as much. We weren’t given examples on how to implement unit tests for partitioners, so I struggled on how to write the code for that, especially since I had to run the test in Eclipse and had to supply the arguments for the DistributedCache through Eclipse, which we never really went over.
