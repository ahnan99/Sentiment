This lab was relatively frustrating because it took many attempts to get any display output when the job was run on the yarn cluster as opposed to locally. Also there were some troubles working with my virtual machine and the jobs were running extremely slow, making it hard to test my scripts, even the local sample data. It was nice to have learned many new frameworks, but I didn't like how many lab dependencies there were for this lab.
