I thought this homework was certainly more difficult than the previous one, where we were mainly familiarizing ourselves with basic concepts. With this homework, we sure did a couple of exercises on concepts, such as problem 2, but they were harder to comprehend because we've never dealt with "writing a java program" in this class before, and both my partner and I had to constantly refer to lecture slides and notes to complete the problem.
