This homework is relatively too much and hard compared to previous one. Each question has too many sub questions. And some of them are not coverd in the lecture and we have to figure it out by ourselves ,which is fine for couple questions but did take time. some of them actually can be easily treated wrongly and will take for ever to solve and debug. I think hw should be easier and straightforward as a semi-system class.
