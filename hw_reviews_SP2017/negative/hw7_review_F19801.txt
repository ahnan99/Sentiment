This homework was way tougher than previous one. One reason was that I didn't have a lot of time studying textbook and slides because of midterms of other classes, so I had some hard time going back and forward between contexts. Also the third part of the problem, page rank, was not carefully delived in class, so I didn't know how to do a lot of things by simply studying lecture notes. So I had to google a lot. But thanks God, I finally completed this homework, during my first day of Spring Break, in Canada...Don't like the feeling of doing homework when I am on break.
