This homework felt a bit tedious and frustrating. The second problem was particularly frustrating because I had a small mistake in my formula that gave some correct results - but it wasn't clear what I was doing wrong. My issues with the first problem were mostly having to explain each dimension, even if it felt unnecessary, and the lack of examples given in the notes for a more nuanced understanding of each dimension.
