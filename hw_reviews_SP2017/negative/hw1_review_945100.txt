In this very first homework, we are doing something quite introductive, rather than a real work or project in cloud computing or data. In addition, most of the questions are subjective, which means there are no specifically correct answer for each of the question, and this makes me a bit of difficult to write up answers. But in total, I have to say this is not a hard one.
