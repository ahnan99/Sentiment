For the problems in hw9, I have the sense that this homework is very time consuming since pig workload is heavy and will cost us a lot of time to wait for the result, but the error check mechanism is not so good, which led us to fail for a lot of times, so that lots of time wasted. Meanwhile, it proved the importance to me that we shall do as discrete small sample test as possbile.
