The problem 1 and 3 are fairly easy and related contents are covered in the class. However, the content for problem 2 is not fully covered in class. Also the description of the problem is ambiguous. I donâ€™t know whether I should combine the mapper output files or not (expect for problem2a). The sequence file is java-only container. I think the class should emphasis on more general things.
