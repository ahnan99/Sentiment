I think this assignment, just like the last one, takes much longer time to finish than the previous two homeworks. I hope there is more example pieces of code for us to follow for the future homeworks, since this one is pretty trial-and-error for us. I did get a lot of help from the TA session as well as the Piazza posts though.
