This hw 7 is totally a disaster. Coding is good, only need to pay attention to some details, but the writing part is really, really making me depressed. We need to write the map in map out reduce in reduce out by hand. I don't know what is meaning of these things. We can write the java code and run and bang that is the result. Why do we need to calculate the value using basic math and then fill them one by one. It is just like human computer. I feel very bad for these homework and still get very confused about some problems. This hw 7 is driving me mad. Tha is all my feelings about that.
