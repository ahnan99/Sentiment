This homework is a bit weired. The first question is too easy and I dont get lots of practice with relative skills. And the requirement is not clear. For example, whether the word appears in next line should be counted as a cop word for the last word in the previous line? How should we count one word line? And other questions like matrix computation should all be taken as coding work but not just easily hand writing and sedo code work. By codinng work I usualy be able to understand the skill much better.
