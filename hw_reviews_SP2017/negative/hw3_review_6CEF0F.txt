I have to say homework 3 is much harder than the two previous homework assignments. The first two questions ask us to understand the concepts related to skew in time and job excution of hadoop system using a service called YARN. It just took me so much time trying to understand the difference between Hadoop 1 and Hadoop with YARN. The lecture could have been clearer in illustrating this concepts.
