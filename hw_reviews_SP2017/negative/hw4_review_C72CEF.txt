The ToolRunner portions of this homework were irritating. Implementing ToolRunner is not difficult, but I had numerous issues with ToolRunner not recognizing options or capturing my command line arguments as ToolRunner arguments. The actual programming aspects of this homework were enjoyable, though I'm not sure how we're supposed to recognize the HTML logs without prior exposure.
