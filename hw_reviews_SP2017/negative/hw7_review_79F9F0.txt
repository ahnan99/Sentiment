This time â€™s homework is a little bit difficult. And since it is our mid-term week, i have to spend a lot of time of reviewing for the exam!!! So so sad for that!!! So tired for busy doing a lot of things in a short time. I felt depressed. But fortunately! It is over!The spring break comes! Happy Spring break!
