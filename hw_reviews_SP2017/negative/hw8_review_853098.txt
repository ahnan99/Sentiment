This homework was difficult.  It was longer than most of the other homeworks and was more open ended.  This was the first time I wish I had worked with a partner.  Especially writing code to analyze the average user rating data and visualize it.  Although it was nice that we were given starter code, it almost would have been easier to write my own solution instead of debugging what I broke in the given implementation.
