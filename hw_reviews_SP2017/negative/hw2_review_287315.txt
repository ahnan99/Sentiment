This homework is clear, straightforward and easy to understand. All the
materials we need have been covered in lab2. After I looked through all
the slides and followed the instructions, I can solve all these problems
using correct answer. My partner and I have discussed on sentimental 
analysis and we got different ideas, so we worked out two suggestions 
successfully. It is very important to understand how MapReduce works 
and I hope this homework will give me a fundamental basis for the 
following assignments.
