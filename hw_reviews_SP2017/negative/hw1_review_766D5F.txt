I thought the homework was easy overall, but I did have trouble when it came to deciding whether a dataset had complexity or not for the first part of the homework. I also struggled a bit to come up with the equation for the second part of the homework, since probability is my weak point. The third part of the homework had questions that were pretty vague, and I wasnâ€™t sure what kind of answer was required of me, but I was probably just overthinking it.
