Homework 4 is really time-consuming, which made me two days focusing on this home work. It not only need me to write code but also takes a lot of time on testing the program. Moreover, we spent many time on thinking the conceptual questions, which are also not very easy to answer. Anyway, this homework make me feel tired, but I did learn a lot from it!
