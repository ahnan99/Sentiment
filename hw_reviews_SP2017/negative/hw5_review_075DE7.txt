This morning I woke up tired. My cat is in heat and was wailing all night long, and since I knew this would keep me up I decided to read to facilitate sleep. When I was sixteen and living with my father and stepmonster in Barrington we had this housecleaner who was in her early thirties. She had instructions from the monster not to let me sleep late in the summers and impede her vacuuming schedule, so she would knock on my door and I would pretend to be asleep.
