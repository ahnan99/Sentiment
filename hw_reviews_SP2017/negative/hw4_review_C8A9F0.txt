Homework 4 has done a good job to remind us of what we've learnt in past lectures, such as run MR program with parameters, test MR program locally, and test MR program using unit test. And the new log file has deepened our understanding about MR program.
Using the senario of web log analysis, problem 2 lead us through all we've learnt and made us to implement them. However, I would like to say that the homework has been confusing. Some questions of the hw, though related closely to what we learnt, took quite amount of time for us to get the point behind it. And the points are so detailed that they may not be covered in lecture.
