I have to admit that this homework is better than all past homeworks. This one includes implementation from scratch, which is very good and effective for us to understand how Map Reduce jobs work when we are solving real problems. The problem 2 and problem 3 are focusing on the concepts and understanding of how recommendation systems work, and how much we understand different schemes of evaluation of similarities. This homework helps to go through all what we learn about the recommendation systems, and it also gives us the opportunity to go thourgh the process of implementation of a map reduce job again. It is fun and helpful.
