I have to say this homework is a mess. Cuz it is totally spread out in different content, skils, and even the file and data we have to use a spread in different folder. By which, I had a tough time to find them all. And it requires to finish the lab. The data from the lab is also in a different folder. It is even tougher since I spend time on midterm and when I came back to work on this hw, I found I have to go through all thsoe thigs to find the file and folder.
