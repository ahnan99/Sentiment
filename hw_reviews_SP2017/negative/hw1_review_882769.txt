I had a lot of trouble with problem 2. I never did quite figure out how to get the last row of the hint table. It would have been nice to have some better explanation on h ow to do this problem. For problem 1, it would be nice to have a more through explanation on the dimensions. The slides and the lecture helped but it wasn't enough (maybe an example of data sets that have or don't have a certain dimension).
