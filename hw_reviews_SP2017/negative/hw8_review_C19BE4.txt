This homework was tricky. I spent like five to six hours on the first part of problem 1, analyzing codes from GitHub and trying to setup enviroment, generate mapreduce codes and test data. And I spent like five hours trying to plot the distribution of average rating per user. It was horrible. I tried Pig, Excel, R, Java and finally got my plot. Don't understand the meaning of doing such great calculation from the raw data file. The other parts were fine and easy, compared to the first part. Anyway two more homework left(probably three?).
