This hw4 is totally destroying me. I am good with the job implemention, although there is still some ambiguity with codes I can deal with it after tryingn several times. It is very time-consuming but not bad. What drives me mad is the numerous tiny questions which I could hardly understand. Every small part has more than one questions, and for several of them I cannot imagine how to answer it. Print statements in local and hadoop mode? Have we ever covered that point in class? What should we bear in mind? Well there is literally no standard answer for such questions. In a word, this hw4 makes me annoyed, frustrated and depressed. My attitude towrds it is Strongly Negtive.
