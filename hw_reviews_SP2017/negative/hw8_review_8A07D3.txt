This homework was extremely frustrating. I was very unsure of how to approach the mapreduce program and I thought that a lot of what we spent time on was really dumb debugging stuff and not really on the code. Also I was pretty unsure about the Item Item Similarity mapreduce program for problem 3. To be honest I've been pretty frustrated with my partner and the fact that he didn't turn in the 2 homework assignments I asked him to turn in. Pretty unfortunate to be honest. I really hope my grade doesn't suck because of him. Kinda stupid cuz no one actually reads this tho :/.
