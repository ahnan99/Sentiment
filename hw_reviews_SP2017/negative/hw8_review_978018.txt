We have a hard time doing this homework. In problem 1 we do not know how to translate ids into titles and it costed a lot of time for us to figure it out. Besides, when we work on problem one, we have not learned pig or hive, so we need to look for tutorials. And for problem three, the computation is in a different way compared with what in PPT, so it is hard for us to get the correct answer without an example.
