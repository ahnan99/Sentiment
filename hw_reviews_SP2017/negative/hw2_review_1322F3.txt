I would say that this homework worked well to solidate my understanding about Lab1 and Lab2, in which we learnt about the basic hadoop file system manipulation and basic MapReduce algorithm. And through the other problems, we deepened our understanding about the system provided functions in MapReduce process. Also, the instructions in labs has been detailed, but limited time left in lecture to complete them, which will become another type of 'homework'.
