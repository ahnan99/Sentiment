Very intersting homework. In this one, professor Newman teaches us how to use combiner and partitioner in our code. On the one hand, the combiners make the process of reduction more efficient by pre-reduce some of the keys so that there are less key pairs sending to the actual reducer. On the other hand, the partitioner help with distributing the blocks of files to the reducer. This helps a lot, really.
