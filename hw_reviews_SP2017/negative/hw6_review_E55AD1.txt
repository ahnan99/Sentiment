The homeworks keep taking longer and longer to finish. This homework had me and my partner very frustrated with debugging errors and unclear directions for where to go. I honestly didn't like this homework very much. I wish doing the homeworks involved less annoying debugging tasks and more implementation of concepts from class. I also heard that a lot of what we're doing is outdated. That would be very tragic if true.
