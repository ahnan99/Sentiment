Currently i am pretty stressed out with everything that is upcoming in my life. I am currently looking for a job and have some interviews coming up. It feels like the amount of work i need to do and prepare for is overwhelming. I am really hoping i can get the ckm advisors job. That would really be an icredible achievement for myself. Please let me get it so i can chill. Otherwis ei feel like my rest of the semester is going to suck eggs. Which i feel like it already is. So lets hope for the best. PCE
