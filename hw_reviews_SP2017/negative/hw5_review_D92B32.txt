I had a bit of trouble with making the partitioning test, I knew my partitioner worked but a forgot about that the file paths. Also for some reason my results for word count and word count with combiner had the combiner having the lower amount of time doing map task, but the question 1 (d) asks why the total time spent for the mapppers is higher when using a combiner. I had the same output, and there is evidence that the combiner ran, so I have no idea why I had different results
