This homework was more difficult than the previous ones - there was more to figure out with the Partitioner. Also, it was confusing at first that we didn't have a package in eclipse - I thought it would be the "partitioner" package, but this contained code related to log files, not Word Count. We got it done, though - this is the second time we've used the late days, and I'm really happy the class has that policy.
