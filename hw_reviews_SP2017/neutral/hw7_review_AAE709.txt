This homework is less challenging than homework 6. It took us more than 5 hours to finish the homework and we think it is not too difficult. The code is running very slow on problem 1. Our MR is also running so slow on our laptop so we are quite frustrated when doing this homework. Problem 2 and Problem 3 is straightforward and very helpful in a way that it helps us understand the concept of matrix multiplication mapreduce better.
