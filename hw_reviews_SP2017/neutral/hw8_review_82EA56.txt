This homework assignment is good, but a little confusing. The first question is programming assignment, and it requires the students to build a whole MapReduce program from the beginning, which is really nice. The second question is related to some comparisons, and requires deeper understanding of methods in collaborative filtering. The third question is mainly based on mapper and reducer inputs and outputs, which will be more comprehensive. One problem is the equation of cosine similarity on the slides is slightly different from the equation from the textbook (MMDS) and Wikipedia, which will lead to some confusion. Further explanation and clarification might be needed for cosine similarity in order to prevent misunderstanding of the students.
