I found this homework to be--probably--the most difficult one yet.  I enjoyed the challenge of writing a word co-occurrence mapreduce program, although I got frustrated because while troubleshooting with the given test sentence I wasn't getting the correct results.  Then I realized I had written the sentence wrong.  The second problem was tough because I have a hard time knowing what to right for pseudo code.
