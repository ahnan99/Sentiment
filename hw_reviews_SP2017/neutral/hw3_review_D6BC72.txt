This assignment was very hands-on, and I enjoyed that there was a coding aspect to it. Actual writing the mapper and reducer functions gave a better understanding of they work. I did have some troubles with getting the job to run in the HDFS which I did not like and it gave me some troubles. However, because of the lab, I was able to run it locally with the same input, and that gave me the desired input, which was much appreciated.
