This homework assignment is a little difficult and theoretical. The first problem is simple program implementation, but not that simple in the analysis of word co-occurrence and its shortcomings. The second problem is the most difficult one, where students need to think about the pseudo-code for matrix and vector multiplications in that the vector does not fit in the memory and we have to divide the vector and the matrix into stripes. The illustration of the example is time-consuming, but worth thinking about the algorithm. The pre-processing is a bit ambiguous, and there might be multiple possible approaches. The communication cost is based on the pseudo-code written before, so if the pseudo-code is not correct, the calculation should also be wrong. The third problem is not hard, based on the information on the book MMDS, we can easily get the results. The matrix vector multiplication is time-consuming so we wrote R programs to calculate the results.
