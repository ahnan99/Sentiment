This is a very good homework assignment. The first problem is related to implementation of ToolRunner, and passing the parameter to the MapReduce program to control the behavior of the program. The second problem is more challenging, with comprehensive questions and programming practices. Student need to know the whole running process, the input, intermediate and output data, as well as the difference between running on cluster and testing locally, in order to answer all questions. Some of the questions are a little ambiguous in meaning, but they can still be answered with detailed explanations.
