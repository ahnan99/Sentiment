In this homework, we tried to figure out some real problem like sentimental analysis and webpage rank. Although this homework is not very hard, but I found that we only did some basic work in this area. For example, we only do the word co-occurrence counting in problem 1, but acutually this is not a very useful job in real problem and it will be more complex when doing sentimental analysis. We also need to consider the time cost which may blow up if the input data is very huge.
