We defiinitely struggled a lot more than we should've on this homework. The stupid part was that we took like 3 hours debugging a very stupid detail that was in the slides and that we should've noticed way faster. Well this is certainly a learning experience to always read carefully and pay attention to detail. Also, Piazza came in pretty clutch as one of the TAs was able to help spur us in the right direction to fix our little detail.
