I like how this homework incorporated some formal proof and qualitative questions instead of coding problems only. However I found it frustrating that the formula for cosine similarity given in class is not the same as the formula given on the wiki page for collaborative filtering, the latter of which made much more sense. It would have been great if the professor and the TAs could have helped us resolve this confusing issue on Piazza.
