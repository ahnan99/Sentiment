This assignment was better than the first.  It built off of labs which was a little annoying because I had cleaned up after the labs thinking we wouldn't need the results.  Luckily the lab was relatively simple so it wasn't a big deal to rerun the mapreduce program.  Overall a relatively easy homework assignment.  One thing though, it is annoying to have to draw figures when we need to export as a pdf.  It is very time intensive.  In the future I would recommend making the assignments text based or screenshots of the terminal.
