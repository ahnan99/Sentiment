This homework we did the problem Computing Word Co-Occurrence. This implementation is not very useful because only counting the words co-occurrence directly next to each other cannot really receive the result which we desire in a document. We also investigate the Maxtrix-vector multiplication in MarReduce program. Unlike the normal matrix operations, we need to consider if the matrix and the vector are too big to be used by Hadoop.
