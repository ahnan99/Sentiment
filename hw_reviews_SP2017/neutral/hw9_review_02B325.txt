This homework is good for practicing Pig and Spark, and understanding some of their mechanism.  But I feel the Spark part is weak. Problem 4 requires to write a simple Spark program, and problem 5 is completed with a few lines either. Also the job monitor for Spark is kind of broken. I can only view stages and tasks when job is running, I have no idea whether this is due to our pseudo-cluster, or it¡¯s Spark¡¯s defect.
