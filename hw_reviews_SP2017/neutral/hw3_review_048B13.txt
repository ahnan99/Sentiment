Problem 1 took me a lot of time to make it, because I do not combine what I leaned from class and what I read from book together, which means, there are two things are different in my view but the same actually. I felt so sad about it, and TA helped me to make it. I  appreciate it.
The problem2 is a good question for me to review knowledge about YARN, which I did not quite understand just after the class, but after studying the slides and book again and again, I started to demonstrate some figure from the slides without the book. It is an improvement, right?
