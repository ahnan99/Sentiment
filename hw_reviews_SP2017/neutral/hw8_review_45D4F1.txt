This homework, similar to other homework, is in average difficulty level. We spend most of the time on the first problem to do the MapReduce of the N list. However, we enjoy working on 1a because it help us understand the material discussed in class, and gain hand-on experience working on map reduce program. Problem 2 and 3 is easier than problem 1. In conclusion, this is a helpful and interesting homework. I hope we will have more interesting homework in the future.
