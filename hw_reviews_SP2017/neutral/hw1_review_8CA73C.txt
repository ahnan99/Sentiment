Overall, I would say that I enjoyed this homework assignment.  It is often difficult for me to describe data in words, so the first question was challenging but helpful. I had fun figuring out the second question and thinking about how to model the probability of a false accusation.  I didn’t love the third problem, because reading and analyzing articles is difficult for me (hence why I’m an engineer), but, similar to the first problem, it was a useful exercise.
