This weekâ€™s homework was way harder than I expected. I still felt the class was interesting and the lab was okay. It was practical but not too hard. However, the recap quiz2 is really hard and I even did not have time to finish all of the questions, which may some how indicated that I was familiar with all the material from the class. Therefore, it is clear that I might also struggle with the homework. However, I think it is a good way to check myself and to motivate myself to catch up with the class.
