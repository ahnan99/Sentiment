I liked this assignment because it introduced a new aspect of mapreduce, which was sequence files and file compression. Investigating the output files was very interesting, and hlped me understand the material better. The checking compression ratio was a bit tedious, and the jobs took a very long time to run on hdfs. However, the output was nice and interesting to see for the inverse indexing.
