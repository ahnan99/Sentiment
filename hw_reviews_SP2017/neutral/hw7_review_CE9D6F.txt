THis homework was very intereseting in that it allowed us to do matrix operations to solve pagerank, a real world application. This was both cool to see work and a bit confusing, because one of the questions requested that I use taxation on a graph without any taps, which resulted in all probabilities to 0. I still dont know if this is the right answer, and did not know that I was unable to get any confirmation on if this was the correct appraoch, intention of the problem. Otherwise, it wasrelatively straightforward and a good set of conceptual exercises.
