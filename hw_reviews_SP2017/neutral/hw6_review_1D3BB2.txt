This homework is more challenging than all the previous homework that we worked on. It took us more than 5 hours to finish the homework and we think it is difficult. The code is running very slow on problem 2. Our MR is also running so slow on our laptop so we are quite frustrated when doing this homework. We hope to get an easier homework next time especially when we only have 1 week for each homework.
