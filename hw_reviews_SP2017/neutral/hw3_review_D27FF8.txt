I think hw3 is a bit challenging overall, but it also made me understand more deeply about the relationship between driver, mapper and reducer, and how to implement each of them as well. One thing I am still kind of confused about is YARN scheduler. Another concept i'm not so sure about is skew. Q1 and Q2 seem to cover some topics that professor didn't spend much time on in the lecture.
