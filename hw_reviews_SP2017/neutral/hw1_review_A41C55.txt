The first homework is kind of an introduction to big data and its application. To complete this homework I spent some times on reading the assigned materials which are a little time-consuming, although the homework itself is not hard than I imagine. My favorite question in this this homework is the second question, because it provides an interesting background behind the math, which makes me feeling how close big data is to our life.
