In this homework, we studied how to implement combiner and partitioner to MapReduce program. At first, I am a little bit confused about distributed cache, but after checking relative parts in the course slide, I remember how it works and finally finished it. But since I am not very familiar with java, I find the code work become more difficult for compared with previous homework. However, more difficulties mean that I can learn more from the homework!
