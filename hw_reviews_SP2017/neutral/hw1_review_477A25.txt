This homework took a long time for me because it was my first time typing an entire assignment in LaTeX. Therefore, I spent time setting up the document and learning syntax as well as actually solving the problems. For problems 1 and 3, I wasn't always sure what the questions were getting at; I hope I justified my answers well enough. For problem 2, I had some trouble deriving the formula and ended up reverse-engineering it from the numerical solutions, though I am not totally sure if my approach or result were correct. The first homework in any class is tricky, because it is hard to know what to expect.
