In my opinion, homework 4 is a bit more challenging compare to the other homework. I and my partner took around 6 hours to finish the assignment.However, I think the homework is useful for our learning and provide a lot of practical assignment. It is practical assignment and also help us deepen our understanding of the MapReduce process.  I hope there will be more problem in the next homework that will be similar this homework.
