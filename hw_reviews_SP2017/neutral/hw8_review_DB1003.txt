This assignment felt particularly practical, which was nice. Part 1 was a little stressful without stubs, but we figured it out eventually. However, I am just very ready to graduate. I am starting to worry about the exam, because there is a lot of material in this class that I understand as I am doing it, but have not necessarily retained well.
