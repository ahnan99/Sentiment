This homework was much lengthier and more complicated than any homework we had done so far. 
There were many times that I was unsure if I would be able to do part of it and alot of the directions
were vague enough were I was unsure if I was even doing the task that I was supposed to be doing.
I would not have been able to do this homework without partner and TA help.
