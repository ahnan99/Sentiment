This homework is about combiner and partitioner. The concept of combiner is fairly easy. I am able to solve the problem 1 easily. The slides of partitioner are somewhat ambiguous and I was struggle about that part. Especially when specifying the second cache file referring to home directory ¡®~¡¯, the command could not recognize the file path. I guess there are some conflicts in the naming rule of Hadoop or linux system.
