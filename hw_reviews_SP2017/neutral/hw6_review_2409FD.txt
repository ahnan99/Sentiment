This homework was super long and required a lot of coding. I spent most of my time debugging codes and googling proper commands, instead of answering questions. This class started to become code-oriented, and the workload was becoming heavier. The knowledge was fine but just required more time comitting compared with previous ones. I need to manage my time properly for next homework since coding is taking more places than before.
