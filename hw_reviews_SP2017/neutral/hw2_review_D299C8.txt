I found this homework to be rather enjoyable, at times, and occaisonally frustrating. For one, on question 4 when we were supposed to find each frequency of a certain list of words, I didn't know how to search the mapReduce output file for the specific words and thus it was time consuming to have to scroll through and find each one.  I did enjoy questions 2 and 3, which were both examples in which we were supposed to work out each step in the MapReduce process. I found these two questions pleasantly thought-invoking, while I thought the fourth question was mostly frustrating.  I prefer working out little problems instead of explaining concepts in words.
