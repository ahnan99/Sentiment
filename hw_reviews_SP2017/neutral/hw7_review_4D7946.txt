This is the week of spring break, and both my partner and I are feeling very lazy when it comes to homework assignments. Luckily, we find this week's material on matrix operations rather easy to understand, so the homework itself wasn't too much of a stretch. However, it still took us a long time to complete - we submitted it late again.
