I feel very split on this homework - I love working in Pig, but I really don't like Spark! Pig seems to come pretty naturally - I liked the lab and think it is a useful tool to know, especially because it also works for local processing of smaller datasets. Spark, on the other hand, just seems really cumbersome to me, and hard to test. Maybe it's that I don't get functional programming yet, but I was really frustrated by the Spark problems.
