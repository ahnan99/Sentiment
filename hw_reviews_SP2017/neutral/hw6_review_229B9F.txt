I think hw6 is not too hard but takes time to understand different concept of MR program, such as Index, SequenceFile, etc. It was consufing at first because the code setup was a little bit off and the execution is sort of different from previous MapReduce java programs. But I still figured out a way to handle and debug it. I am not so sure about the "compression ratio", but I used byte count of uncompression rate divided by compression rate.
