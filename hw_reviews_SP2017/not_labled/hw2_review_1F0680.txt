This homework is not very hard as long as I follow the instruction in homework page and lab slides. For problem number 2 and 3, it took some calculation and paper work, so I wrote them down on a paper. Hope this will not be unclear and cause point deduction. The question number 4 is relatively easy and simple to write within word.
