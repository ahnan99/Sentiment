Homework 1 is not very hard. The first problem of dimensions/properties may be controversial for some certain data. The second problem took me a couple minutes to figure that out. I have some questions about the semantic analysis though. If I say something like "holy shot" to represent my emotion, it can be positive like when I am really amazed by something, or it can be strongly negative. What will happen then? Can it analyse by context?
