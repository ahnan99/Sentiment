Since my former partner droped this class, I'm quite depressed. But finally I found another one for this assignment. Hope things get easier. For this homework, it is not very hard. The only thing is that it is tedious to draw the plot and mathmatic functions. So I didn't draw the plot. Hope this won't affect my grade.
