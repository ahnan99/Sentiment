I'm tired. Why there are so many homeworks? Why this course is so hard? And you know what, my partner droped this course in the middle of the semester!!! I can't handle this course any more. But I cannot drop because I need to graduate this semester. I didn't finish this homework entierly. I guess I will get a B.
