Hw7 was terrible. The amount of stupid busy work was way too much. The questions were vague and annoying. Especially question 3, we might get random things wrong because of the confusing nature of of the questions k by n by z by i + j. This is seems like a trick question just to test your attention skills not to see if you actually know how it works
