This homework was easier than the other homeworks. It was actually fun, but still long. I worry that I don’t really understand the material even though I was able to do the homework—some of it felt like just plugging work in. In addition, I felt like class / lecture this week was honestly pointless. I go, but I don’t learn anything.
