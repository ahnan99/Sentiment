This homework is a very good practice of the previous taught knowledge. The first problem is a practice of passing parameter using ToolRunner, which was mentioned in the class but not actually put into application during the lab. The second problem is a combination of all the past knowledge points. It helps me understand those points as a whole, and all the separated knowledge points now make sense to me.
