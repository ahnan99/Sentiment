Problem 1 was doable. Problem 2 was also easy. Problem 3 was kind of weird, it was quite unclear as there were so many things that I didn't know what to do like 
the stats things that should we use rating, sum and number or just rating. It seemed reasonable to just use rating but again, I was not sure. Submitted whatever 
we thought is okay.
The homework overall was okay.
