This homework is not easy, and I think professor should give more guide about Spark. I thought I could start my final exam review this week. But I didnâ€™t. I have to start another final project for 438, so another busy week. What make me happy is, Thanksgiving day is coming! And no homework this week! Happy Thanksgiving!
