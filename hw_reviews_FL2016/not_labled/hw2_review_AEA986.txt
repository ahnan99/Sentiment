This homework assignment had me going back to a lot of lab write ups (of which I am now definitely grateful for). I think the questions overall were intuitive. I especially liked the java comments in the stub files. However, it was very frustrating to have to essentially redo lab 2 and change some permissions. That caught me off guard for awhile. The homework had a good mix of problems to work through as well as conceptual questions. I wish, though, there be some more math. Overall, I think I have learned the concepts of Hadoop HDFS well through this homework.
