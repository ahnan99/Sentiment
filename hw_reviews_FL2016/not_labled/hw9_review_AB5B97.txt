This homework was really helpful for me in understanding how the PIG scripts worked. Initially, I wasn't sure what the purpose was for PIG scripts but the lab and the homework was a great help. The lab instructions were incorrect at some places and that was a little annoying. Also, the test data required for the homework was not in the correct format which was also annoying. But once I figured out what input to use things became very clear.
