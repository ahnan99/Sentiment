I really enjoyed this homework, since we got more hands on experience with "real" MapReduce functionality. I thought it was interesting comparing the various similarity indexes and seeing how they compare things like Netflix movies and products on Amazon. Since I use these two services pretty regularly, I found it very interesting to look at them from a cloud computing angle instead of a customer angle.
