Not sure what I feel about this. As always, I need to write some feelings so that I get extra credit. But I'm actually writing this before doing the lab - I've seen the questions, I'm just writing my feelings in anticipation of actually working on the answers. Because I have about 15 minutes right now. And because if I start on the questions now it'll be 10minutes for the VM to boot up and 5 minutes to open all the slides
