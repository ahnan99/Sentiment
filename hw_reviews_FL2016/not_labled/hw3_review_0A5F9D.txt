I thought this assignment was a good summary of testing and running local mapreduce jobs. I was confused at the comparison questions of local methods, becuase I thought we did not get very deep into either method, and it was not the time to make us decide which method we like better without knowing more about the underworking of each. However, the rest of the lab was very good and I think i learned a lot.
