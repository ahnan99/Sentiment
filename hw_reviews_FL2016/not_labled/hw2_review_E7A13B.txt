This work is a lot but not very difficult.
Problem1 and problem2 is easy, just follow the instruction.
Problem3 is a little troublesome, especially the SA question. Although this question is not too hard, but it took a lot of time in study what is SA.
Problem4 is a simple coding with Java. Coding part is OK, but we met some problem when setting our environment, thatâ€™s the tricky part.
