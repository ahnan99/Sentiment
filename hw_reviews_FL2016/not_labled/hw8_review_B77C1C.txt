HW 8 was interesting. I like that we were able to use the Netflix data to make it seem more like a real world application. I wonder why we had to agree to delete all the data after we finished the homework. What if I didnâ€™t want to agree to that, would I not be able to complete the homework? Anyways, I like that the topic of similarity and recommendation systems are so pertinent to the technologies I interact with on a daily basis.
