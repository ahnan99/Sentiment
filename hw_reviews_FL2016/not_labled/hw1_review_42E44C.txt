This homework was pretty good for a first homework. It wasn't too challenging thankfully since we haven't really covered a lot in lecture yet but at the same time I think I learned something. The second problem actually took some thinking about to solve but overall it only took a few hours. Hopefully we can actually start doing some cloud computing soon.
