I thought that this lab was very tedious. It took a long time for us to constantly create new jar files while using ToolRunner. It was frustrating that in HW3 we were told that it was usually better to run MapReduce locally using Eclipse but then were forced to use ToolRunner even in cases where we didn't need to do configuration parameters on the fly. However, I did enjoy learning more about how to use MapReduce and I found the HW to be helpful in that regard.
