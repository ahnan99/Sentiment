I really enjoyed this third homework because on the last homework, I found it pretty frustrating and difficult to de-bug code when our only way of testing was through Hadoop's output messages on the command line. Testing in Eclipse, either through junit tests or through full program runs, it makes it extremely easy to debug and write correct code. I am very excited about this new ability and can't wait to use it on further coding assignments in this class. Definitely one of the more useful and practical homework assignments we will have in this class because we can use our knowledge of unit tests in other coding assignments.
