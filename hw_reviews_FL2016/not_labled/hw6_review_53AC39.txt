I was stressed out this week so I did not have time to work on the homework. Problem 1 required the bulk of the work and a lot of time that I didnâ€™t have so instead I focused my time on problems 2 and 3. Problem 1 was more difficult concept wise than the last two problems which were more straightforward.
