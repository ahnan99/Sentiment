HW2 was comparable to HW1 in my opinion. I worked with a partner for this homework which definitely made it easier than the first one. I enjoy the collaborative nature of working with a partner much more than working by myself. I feel like Iâ€™m really starting to understand that concepts that the homework is covering which gives me a strong sense of confidence.
