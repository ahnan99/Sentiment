I really enjoyed working with something other
than mapreduce. PIG reminds me a lot of MySql
which I'm relatively familiar with. Aside from that
I think the homeworks are a bit too frequent.
Having one every week seems a bit too much to me
especially having one due next week right before
thanksgiving. I also didn't like how the lab depended
on the studio since I'm not 100% if I got everything on
the studio right.
