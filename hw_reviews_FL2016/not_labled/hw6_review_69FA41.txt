I thought that homework 6 was a good representation of the tools we learned recently including compression and algorithms like inverted index. Coding the algorithms in question 2 and 3 were a good way to learn to learn the intricacies of how they worked and see them in action. In addition, analyzing the compression algorithms in questions 1 was also a good way to learn about that.
