HW 2 was far more straightforward than the first assignment because of the objectivity of the material.  I felt that the questions were much clear and less subjective to ambiguity.  I also felt that now that we have been having class for a few weeks now, I have a strong foundation in how cloud computing works and much better understand the material as a whole. This has likely made this most recent assignment much simpler to complete.
