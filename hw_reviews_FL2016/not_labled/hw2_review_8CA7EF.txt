I think the firt part of this homwwork is pretty simple because I understan what exactly I should do. Therefore, I feel very happy. However, the second part is difficult to me because, honestly, I did not understand the concept duting the class. I feel frustrated when I do these problems. By the way I use the extension again, which makes me feel hurry because I have another homework to due. I think I will feel better if I start the homework ealier.
