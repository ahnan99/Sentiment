Homework 10 was not too long, but some of it is a little confusing. Problem one was doable based on what we have learned in class, but problem two was a little confusing at first because I didn’t quite understand how to use the provided functions in the shell. After figuring that out, debugging pyspark is also a little hard, since sometimes the error message is not very informative and I couldn’t understand which part was going wrong. Problem 3 of the homework was not too bad, although the client mode did not go very smoothly for me.
