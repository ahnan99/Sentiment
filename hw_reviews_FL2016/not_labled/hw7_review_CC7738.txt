This homework did not require programming, which is a quite relief for me. I was really down this week since I failed Amazon interview. Some people attending interview together with me got offers, which made me more frustrating. But then I decided to move on, now I am preparing google’s OA, and I hope homework8 would not be too hard to finish. It is November now, it’s time to work hard to seek fortunate. I wanna a job. I wanna an offer. I wanna money.
