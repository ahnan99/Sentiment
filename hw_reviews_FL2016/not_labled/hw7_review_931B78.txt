This homework was pretty easy. Im really hoping that the TAs aren't unreasonably harsh in grading the pseudocode because to be honest theres not a lot to write for what it should do. Sometimes they seems to grade based on length and not on quality, though. The concept of matrix vector multiplication is really importnatt though when working with big data so this was definitely an important homework to have completed. Looking forward to completing more future assignments.
