Problem 1 seemed easy but was not so. 

Part (a) was easy, Professor Neumann repeated the "are there any differences in the job execution" twice in the class, so was pretty straight forward.

Part (b) however was not so easy, it was tricky to deal with default configurations and the other methods to set configurations.
And its "are there any differences in job execution" was confusing because was not sure if it would be asked again if it had the same answer.

Part (c) was easy.

Problem 2 seemed scary at first because it was 70% of the homework and had so many subparts, but was quite interesting.
