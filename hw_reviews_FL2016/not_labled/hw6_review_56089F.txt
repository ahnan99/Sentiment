I found this homework significantly more difficult than the last few because of the sequence file problem. Before this, we had never had to write or read output from files (this was handled by the hadoop framework) so this created a significant challenge for me. The other two problems were much easier because they were just designing a couple MR algorithms that we could look to the notes for help with. I especially utilized the MRUnit testing framework to debug my solutions to these two problems which was great to use.
