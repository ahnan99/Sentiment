Bored. Worried about that fact that I missed the registration for the undergrad research symposium by about a month. Worried that I might not be able to graduate with honors. Crapped out by the stress of moving. By the stress of everything. That I still have to do this homework, this class is such a time such and the VM moves so slowly. Too much to do and too little time.
