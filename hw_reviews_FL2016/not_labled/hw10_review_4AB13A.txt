I thought that this was an interesting homework assignment, particularly the third question. This question was a good introduction to writing spark programs, and I like how with spark we have the option of working in both python and scala. We chose python, as both of us know that better, but the option to have both made us look at both the python and scala codes in the slides, and I think that I could replicate the code that I wrote in python in scala now. There was some frustration in the assignment though - we ran into some memory issues on one of our VMs, and these were hard to address.
