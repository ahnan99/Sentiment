This homework was much better than the first homework. I liked that there was a programming question and we were able to actually submit jobs to the hadoop cluster. The average word length was a simple map reduce task and I am sure that the implementations are going to get much more difficult throughout the semester. I look forward to analyzing these homework reviews! We will probably use a similar algorithm to those discussed already and compare the contents of each homework review to a dictionary of emotionall descriptive words.
