This homework has much work than the previous four homeworks. However it was useful too. We have worked with Distributed Cache,combiner and partitioner techniques in Hadoop Mapreduce framework. In addition, we have defined our own Writable Data type. We have applied map reduce on sentiment analysis job which is interesting. I think it was a useful homework, but a bit time consuming.
