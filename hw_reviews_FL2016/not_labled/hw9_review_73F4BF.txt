This homework is very helpful for me to understand how pig works and be familiar with the pig grammar. It is straight forward for me to go through problem 1 and 2. But I got stuck for a while when I was working on problem 3. The word “aggregate function” confused me as I thought it might be some built-in pig command (which turned out to not exist). Also, I made a mistake to call COUNT(data.was_clicked) instead of COUNT(clicked.was_clicked). After I corrected it, errors disappeared. And problem 4 is trivial.
