this homework was honestly a nice break after the absolutely brutal assignment that was homework 8. Further, although I didn't understand much of the PIG material when it was covered in lecture and lab, I went back through the slides and was able to teach myself. The homework also reinforced this learning in a positiveway. Thank you.
