This homework's workload is more representation of what I would like to see in 427 homeworks generally. It has well defined steps in the prompt, and each
section is related but isolated from the others in the sense that getting one part wrong will not directly affect your performance in the other parts.

Additionally, it serves as a good fresher course in Pig Latin syntax, especially since a lot of people may not have experience in data flow languages like it.
My main criticism is that the set up for this homework (e.g. lab 5) was not carried out very effectively last week, so laying the groundwork to do this homework
was a little too tedious and sometimes confusing.
