This homework seemed pretty useful. It wasn't super hard as long as you knew where to look up the commands/functions online and that wasn't hard to figure out at all. After that point, it was all just "Oh, categorize this? Easy!" and then you just bust it out. Did have a problem trying to find out how to get the maximum value of cpc and then multiply it by 50000 as that max_value was a bag. Couldn't figure out how to handle a bag -> integer processing.
