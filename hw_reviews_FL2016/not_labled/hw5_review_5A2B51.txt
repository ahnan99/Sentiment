I found this homework to be one of the bettter ones we have done. I thought that each problem was fair, and taught us different things. It was a good way to learn about all of the topics and to implement what we used in class. It's funny that you had us talk about why what we did is not a good way to get stats on emotion, while you're recording our own stats on emotions with these files. I'm excited to see the results!
