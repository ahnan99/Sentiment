I thought homework 6 was a lot harder than the previous homeworks, especially the first problem, since a lot of the parts did not have explicit instruction on how it works, and I havenâ€™t seen similar problems on the slides so I did not know how to approach the problem. Problems 2 and 3 are a lot more doable than problem 1. Overall, I spent more time on this homework than on most of the previous homeworks, and also got stuck or confused a lot more. But I did end up learning a lot from the homework. Maybe clearer instruction or more explanation on how to approach things would help.
