homework 2 was a lot more tedious. i like the conceptual problems more than programming. i wish more java programming examples could be done in class instead of being rushed through it at the end of the lecture. i would enjoy the coding more if it there were more demos done in class before the homework is due. i enjoy the mapreduce questions where i have to think of space and how best to optimize the map and reduce function. i wish the monday TA would have more consistent TA hours.
