HW 1 Review:I thought that the homework was relatively easy.  The first question was an anticipated one, and it helped me review the 6 dimensions to big data.  The second question was the most difficult question in the assignment, but after reviewing some basic principles of probability, I was able to figure it out. The last problem was also not too bad, and the article that accompanied it was fascinating, albeit not an easy read.  But I think I learned a lot from this assignment.
