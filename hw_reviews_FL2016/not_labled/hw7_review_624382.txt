This homework 7 was not as practical as other homeworks. That is to say it was less hands on and coding and more theory based. The subject matter was interesting and I felt like we had the resources to do the homeworks on our own without too much trouble. There wasnâ€™t as much time lost to troubleshooting software problems.
