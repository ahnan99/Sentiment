this homework is really helpful, i learn a lot about how to calculate different kinds of multiplication, like matrix vector multiplication adn matrix matrix multiplication. Also, the process of writing pseudo code helps me understand and learn the nature of these multiplication too. what i have to mention here is that the book MMDS is really useful and helpful. to be honest, i cannot understand what is multiplication just through the slide.The MMDS helps me!
