This homework was very straightforward and very easy in my opinion. I prefer to do programming assignments so I was not very happy with the question format. Big data is an intresting topic that spans a varity of disciplines, and I feel that the main point of this homework was to give an introduction to the structure and format of big data in real world applications. Hopefully there will be more programming questions in the future. Overall I would rate this homework as positive.
