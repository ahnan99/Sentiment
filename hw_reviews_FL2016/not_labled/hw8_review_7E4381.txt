This homework was pretty fun. To me, it was a right balance between coding and written components, and I was able to better understand all the concepts we were exposed to in the homework. Problem 1 was a little hard to debug, especially when we are running two jobs on such a large data set, but putting our knowledge to a real world problem was very cool. However, part b of problem one was a little inconvenient, since we have not yet learned pig or hive, so generating a distribution plot was very time consuming, since I had to search for how to make the plots in excel, which I thought was not very relevant to the class and did not help much in my understanding of the material.
