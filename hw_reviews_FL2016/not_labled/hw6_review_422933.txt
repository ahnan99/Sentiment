This homework was a little longer than all of the other homeworks, but it provided valuable insight into real world applications of mapreduce. The inverted index problem is one that we have dicussed in class and is used in a variety of text mining applications. Compression is also extemely useful because it allows us to run our programs efficiently without having to use more storage space than needed. There were many files that we had to code for this homework which I liked. I do not like a lot of written questions and would much prefer more homeworks that focus on coding such as this one.
