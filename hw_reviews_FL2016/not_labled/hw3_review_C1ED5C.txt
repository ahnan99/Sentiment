This week, home work is straight forward. No much reading material. I spend some time to understand the lab instruction, to run map reduce job locally in multiple ways. Also, I google some information about the map reduce job testing steps. I learn a lot of practical skills from this week lab session that make me very happy. Also, there is some open question for reduce task performance. I discuss with my partners and search some information online that make me think a lot about cloud computing service. Wonderful week!
