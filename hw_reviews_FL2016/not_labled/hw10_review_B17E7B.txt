I thought this homework went fairly well. I got confused on some of the wording at times but I think over all I did it correctly.  I had trouble finding out information on where the results for tasks are stored but I think I found it in one of the slides. I also spent a ton of time trying to split the collection returned by the getactivations function but was never able to do it. I just wrote another function to get around it.
