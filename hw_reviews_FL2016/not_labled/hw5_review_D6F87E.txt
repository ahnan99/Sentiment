This homework was significantly harder and longer than the previous homeworks. While it was definitely interesting, I found it much more challenging (especially the second problem) and I had to go to the TA hours for help. Definitely a rewarding experience being able to finish this homework and really understand how to implement many of the methods that we learned about in class such as partitioners, combiners, and custom writables. It was one of the more challenging homeworks though for sure.
