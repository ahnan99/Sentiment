For this homework, it contains three questions. All of them did not contain any serious implementation of matlab codes. First one was about matrix-vector multiplication. First two subproblems were not hard, but the third one was pretty confusing. For second problem, it was book problems about PageRank. For first two subproblems, we have to write small matlab codes to calculate PageRank of two different figures. Last subproblem was straightforward. The last problem was about matrix-matrix multiplication. We have to figure out different numbers for mapper and reducer keys and key-value pairs. Then, have to think about memory usage and communication cost. Overall, homework was pretty long, but fun.
