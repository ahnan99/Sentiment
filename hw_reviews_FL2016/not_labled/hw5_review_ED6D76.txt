This was a cool lab. Some of the instructions were unclear, such as implementing a Distributed Cache with our partitioner.  It took a long time to figure out that the Distributed Cache code is put in the driver. Still, it was cool seeing the sentiment and positivity scores for problem 2.  WritableComparables were also cool, as they start to show how you can do big data on more complex inputs than just simple text.
