This homework was more conceptual than all previous homework. It is hard to judge if we are doing a homework correctly or not, which is one part that I don’t really like about the homework. However, it is much shorter than the last homework and takes a reasonable amount of time, which is nice. Overall, the homework was okay, it was not really fun because we don’t get to implement an actual MapReduce program for matrix multiplication, but it still helped my understanding of the material.
