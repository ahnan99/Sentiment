I think this homework has been one of the easiest so far. There was a lot of information to get through but it was presented well in the book.  The very last problem I struggled with because I couldn't really find the correct answer.  I'm hoping my answer will be accepted by I mainly was guessing at that point because the book seem to only cover one specific proof for two matrixes of the exact same size.
