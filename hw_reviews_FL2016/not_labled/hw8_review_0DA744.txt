As always, this homework helps me a lot on understanding the application 
of MapReduce on recommendation, especially the first problem. I tried the 
chained driver implementation, and encountered several bugs. This experience
increases my learning interest in pig or hive. The second problem provided a
good practice of similarity measuring by comparing different approaches of 
measuring similarity. Overall, it is a good homework. It would be better if
we could have more coding.
