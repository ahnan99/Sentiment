This assignment was pretty conceptual, finally, I don't have to write some code in the VM. However, it still required us to write the pseudocode which I don't quite understand what need to be written done. The communication cost is very confusing to me and the memory usage cost, too. I'm not quite sure what's the difference between these things, is the things we need to store in the memory called memory cost?
