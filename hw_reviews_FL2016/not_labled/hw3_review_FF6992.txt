The first problem is about skew. It helpers us understand the relationship between reduce function and reduce task. The second problem is about data locality in map phase. In the third problem, we wrote unit tests for Mapper, Reducer and MapReduce function which is a very practical problem. We test MapReduce program locally in the fourth problem. Both of third and fourth problem are very practical and tests are very important before we run the real jobs in cluster.
