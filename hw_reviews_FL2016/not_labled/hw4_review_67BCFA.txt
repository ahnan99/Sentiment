There were few things that troubled us starting with the the ToolRunner command that really never ran until we figured out the error.

However, since this one had a command line tool that always took the default boolean. After we got through that hurdle, things got a lot smoother as problem number 2 was just doing the entire Hadoop MapReduce from start to finish.
