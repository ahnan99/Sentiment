This homework is pretty interesting. It has more explaination work to do. Like problem 1, 2 and 4, I need to search and read a lot of articles to know what it is talking about. Testing locally is a pretty good way to know whether the program is right or not. But I think unit testing is quite a annoying because it need to write a lot. I'm really glad to know the way to test mapreduce program without using a cluster.
