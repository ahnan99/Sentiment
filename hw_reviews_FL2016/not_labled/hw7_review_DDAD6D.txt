Through this homework I learned about different techniques for matrix to matrix multiplication and matrix to vector multiplication. If a vector can not be brought into memory, it (along with the matrix) can be divided into stripes so that the vector components can be brought into memory. Similarly, for matrix multiplication, matrices can be divided into square blocks to fulfill memory requirements. However, this comes with a tradeoff - the larger the groups sizes, the lower the communication cost. However, the smaller the group sizes, the higher the communication costs.
