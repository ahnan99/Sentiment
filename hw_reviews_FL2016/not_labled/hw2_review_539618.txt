This Hw was not too difficult. I felt that this hw accurately reflected the material learned in class up until now. The java part at the end was a little bit difficult but I was able to figure it out with the help of the Ta’s. I did have some trouble with my virtual machine so that was annoying but It was not too bad. If all of the Hw’s were this difficulty the course would be very fair.
