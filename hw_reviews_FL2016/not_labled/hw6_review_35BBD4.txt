I spend a lot of time to figure out this homework but learn a lot for file compression. There are three questions that each of them cover one topic and all of them are meaningful. However, the slides for this chapter is relative simple comparing to other topics so that I don’t get much information on slides. I spend a lot of time search online for file compression information and then finally find the solution. Also, from start, I am confused on the signature, don’t know the meaning of it. But I discuss with classmates for that and finally figure it out. This chapter is funny because it contains a lot of coding problem.
