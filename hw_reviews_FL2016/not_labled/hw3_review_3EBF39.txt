This homework had stuff that either I wasn't paying attention in class for, or just that I had to read the book for. It had some more conceptual stuff that I liked as well as I thought that the testing and running locally had some really good practical applications. I was really frustrated of how much setup and finangling I had to do to get the mapreduce program to run on the command line. Oh well.
