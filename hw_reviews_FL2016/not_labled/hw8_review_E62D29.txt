Homework 8 had some unclear elements that made me feel genuinely confused. I felt like the slides provided insufficient reference material and the lectures provided inadequate practice.

Some answers could not be found in the lecture slides, readings, or after extensive web searching. As you can imagine, this is somewhat frustrating and concerning for future classwork.
