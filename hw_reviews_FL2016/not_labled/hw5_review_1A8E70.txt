This homework covers topics including combiner, partiner and customer based writable and writecomparable. Meanwhile, the configuration of two involved drivers is realized with ToolRunner. So I would say this homework provide a comprehensive practice over the last two weeks' material, which is greate. In this homework, I spent a lot of time on the second problem. I tried hard to find a way to get name of the file in DistributedCache from configuration. It would be greate if Professor could cover some in the lecture.
