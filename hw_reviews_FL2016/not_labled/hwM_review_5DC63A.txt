This homework was actually really easy, however, I'm pissed that I had to do it. I was able to show professor neumann the day after homework2 was due that although my partner and I screwed up the commit,we  hadn't modified our submission. In my mind, being stringent and lacking empathy to keep us from receiving credit intially was unecessary. The purpose of an educational experience, again in my mind, is to learn. I'm not sure what I learned through this experience -- maybe it was intended to be a life lesson about being responsible (as if thats some foreign concept to my partner and I that CSE427 prides itself on teaching).
