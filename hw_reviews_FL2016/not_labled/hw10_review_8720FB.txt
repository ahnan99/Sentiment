For this homework, it contains three questions. I had to use a sample data generated from lab6, so I had to finish the lab first to actually start on the homework. I struggled because the path was not right for a few times. However, using spark with commands was not that difficult. All the commands were straight forward and easy to learn. I had to transform data using RDD, parse a set of records with ETL operations, and finally write a complete spark program. Except the spark was hard to debug, everything else was pretty easy. Overall, homework was pretty long, but fun.
