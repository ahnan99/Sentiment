i think this home work is really good. it let me have a comrehensive understanding of what we learned in the class. the first part of the homework 5 is to use combiner knowledge to program. actually, in the lecture, i cannot understand well of what professor are talking, but through this homework, i think i have a deep understand of what is combiner and how to write it. the problem 3 is excellent, it help me to review what we learned before and give us a better opportunity to practise it.
