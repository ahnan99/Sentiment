Homework 1 was a mix of challenging and reasonable. I felt prepared for the first problem because we had reviewed similar problems in class. However the second problem was very difficult as I have not reviewed probability in a while and it took me a long time to get the problem. Problem 3 was also reasonable and the article was interesting to read.
