This homework is all about PIG, implementing pig scripts, running it on the cluster, and getting the results we want. Pig latin is like a scripting language, well most likely to be similar to SQL queries. Easy to use, easy to understand. The Apache Pig framework take care of written script and run it as a MAPREDUCE job. In the way, developers avoid coding hard Java programs to get the MAPREDUCE job done. I like this way very much.
