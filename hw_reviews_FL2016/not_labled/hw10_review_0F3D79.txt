This week we study about the spark. I have heard this application before for many times, and really want to know how to use it. It's pretty cool to program with python again, I used python 2 year ago and that's the time to do it again. And python is a great language for data analysis, as well as R, which is my main programming language now. SPARK is also very fast, it's a very good news. And I think I'll try to use spark in my final project.
