this homework took me a bit longer than I had anticipated. it was because i didn't fully understand how to implement load runner...but now I do. I thought this homework illuminated the overarching workflow quite well. I think a lot of concepts were testing and my knowledge was challenged. I felt like I did okay. I think there could have been a lot more clarity in the homework thought.
