This homework took a considerable amount of time; this was the first time we used our late extension to turn it in. I liked how the homework incorporated concepts we learned in the recent lectures as well as past lectures. At the same time, we ran into some unclear errors when testing and running the hadoop programs, which was a frustrating experience. I think the homework was significantly longer than previous homeworks.
