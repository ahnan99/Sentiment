In this homework I learned how to use ToolRunnerâ€™s GenericOptionsParser to readily pass in arguments. I learned that configurations could be set (by order of priority) via default configurations, xml configuration property files, the command line, and through the driver. We got our first taste of big data in the weblog data containing the http transactions of hundreds of thousands of ip addresses. I learned that though the easiest way to ensure a globally sorted result set is by using a single reducer, another way is by creating custom partitioners that partition keys in certain disjoint ranges to different partitions. Once these partitions are sorted by themselves, they can be combined to produce globally sorted results. I also found that the same reducer for WordCount could be applied to count the number of distinct ip addresses in the weblog files.
