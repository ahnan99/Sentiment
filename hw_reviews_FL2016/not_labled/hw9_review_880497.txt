This home work was interesting. Doing the lab was very helpful.
There were times when we couldn't figure things out, it might be
very helpful if we can get more information like sample code to
do stuff in pig, it took a long time because the slides didn't
have the code needed and on the internet also, there was a little
different way to do the same thing.
