This homework was OK. I don't really like the problems where we are asked to justify things with short essays because I feel like that leaves the grading way too much up to the discretion of the TA and not how much you actually understand the problem. In terms of the coding stuff, I think I have a much better understanding now of how to code in a real dev environment. Although I'm still not sure when I would run mapreduce jobs locally instead of on the cluster.
