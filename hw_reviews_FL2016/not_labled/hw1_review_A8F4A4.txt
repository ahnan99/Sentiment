I personally thought that the hardest problem was problem number 2, it was really difficult to grasp and understand what the principle meant and how to get the answer from the problem that was stated. The first problem was okay as there wasn't really a wrong answer; however, problem 3 was very different. I thought that problem 3 was not very hard, but the article was difficult to read. It The language was hard to understand and I feel like I might have gotten some terms mixed up while reading the article.
