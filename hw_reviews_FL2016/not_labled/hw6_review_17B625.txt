This homework took a while to complete. Using the Identity Mapper was kind of confusing; I don't think we were ever explicitly taught about its functionality before. The sequence file writer was also frustrating, since I wasn't expecting there to be compressed content for the normal sequence file creater. Thus, when looking at the output, it was unexpected. The indexer was interesting to implement.
