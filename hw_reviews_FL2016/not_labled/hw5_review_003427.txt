I liked this homework more than the previous homeworks because it involved a lot of programing and little question answering. I much prefer to actually write code than to discuss it in an answer to a question. The combiner seems like a useful tool to help speed up map reduce tasks, and the partitioner is great for sorting and classiflying data. My least favorite question was question 3. The driver class was a little tricky and was unlike other MapReduce jobs we have seen so far. Luckily there is no homework next week and I can spend the time reviewing this and other exams in order to prepare for the midterm exam.
