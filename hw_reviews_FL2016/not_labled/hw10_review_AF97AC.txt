This homework is a challenge for me since I met a huge difficulty in iniating spark and run the applications on cluster and 
locally. I think the major problem for me is spark shell for me is a totally new thing, so are scala and python. So I'm really struggling
with setting up right in scala and python and learning these new languages and syntax. However, I really learn a lot during 
the process and I think it will be better to have more helping hours on Wednesday to help me with the learning process.
