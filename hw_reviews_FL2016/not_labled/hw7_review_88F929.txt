This week we study about some applications for the mapreduce. To be honest, I have done some text mining before, but I havenâ€™t used the TF-IDF, which is quite interesting. And I have studied PageRank many times, but this is my first time to think it in the mapreduce program. The multiplication with block is quite amazing, it can just reduce the dimension, spending time to get less communication cost.
