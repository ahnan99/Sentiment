I really enjoyed this lab. I thought the practical side of cloud computing was really cool, and I'm so glad we finally got to work on the "cool" part of cloud computing. I hope that we continue to learn new technologies and improve our understanding and improve our knowledge of what technologies are out there, and what they are usually used for.
