As I am somewhat familiar with SQL, it was not too hard to figure out what was going on. However, my virtual instance that I work on does not show the output of PIG as everyone else's. My result comes out with every single line of the script and the result are also mixed with other texts. Thus I had to rely on my partner to work on it and had a hard time trying to work together. Except for that problem, the homework was very straightforward except for some questions that needed to be clarified with the TA.
