I was not a fan of this homework. There wasn't really any coding in this homework, and the coding is usually my favorite part as it helps me learn the best. Additionally, I found the first problem in particular to be very confusing, as it was unclear what the question was looking for. There also wasn't much help for any of the problems in the notes. I definitely enjoyed this homework less than the others.
