Here's review time. Stuck bored as usual, glad I have time time and thought of doing this. Well this homework wasn't too bad. Pretty good actually, I guess. I had to do the other part of the lab I thought I didn't have to do, and it's kind of annoying we had to do the lab to do this. But otherwise it was fine.
