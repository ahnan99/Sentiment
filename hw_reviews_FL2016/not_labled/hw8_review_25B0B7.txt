I feel particularly disillusioned during this homework, not necessarily because of the homework itself but by how disillusioned I was by the people of this country. In comparison to the result of this election, this homework makes me feel not much at all. I don't understand what has happened to the point where we have this unqualified bigoted idiot as president.
