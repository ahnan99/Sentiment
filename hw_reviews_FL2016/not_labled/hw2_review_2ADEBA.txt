This homework made me a little nervous as it was the first homework with a partner. I guess a part of it had to do with the fact that I actually didn’t know of my partner beforehand. However It was definitely easier than I thought it would be. Several parts of the homework where I wasn’t sure of my partner was able to help me and some parts where he was confused on I helped him. All in all I think the homework really helped me learn and I am glad that I did it.
