This homework furthered my understanding and it was not too difficult. I felt that there was not a roboust explanation of what was required for the unit testing, but through Piazza there was plenty of explanation as to what I was supposed to do, so I guess I gained some satisfaction with how the homework went but I also am anxious as to whether or not I did it correctly.
