I liked how the ratio of hands on coding/work we had to do for this
lab. I felt like that really helped me understand the material.
This was one of those homeworks which went very smoothly. I was
actually thinking about finishing it late since I started late, but
to my pleasant surprise it was smooth sailing till the finish. I
wouldn't call the homework easy but there was never any point where
I got stuck.
