I was glad to finally work on an actual application instead of just learning the basics of map reduce. I did think that some of the wording of the questions were a little odd, and confused us a bit. Also, I do not thing piazza is a place to post a change to the homework (3b). Either keep the question as is, or change it on the homework.
