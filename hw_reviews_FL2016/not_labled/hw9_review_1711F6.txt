I feel excited about learning a new technology PIG. Before I study this course, I have no concept of Big data and cloud computing, but now I feel more confidence to this area. The process of doing homework helps me to get a good understanding of the course. I think big data now is a tendency which leads us to the future. We need to study harder to get more wisdom from data, which means countless values for us.
