I think this homework is quite straight forward, it tests our ability to run these projects locally, which is what I need in the last homework,
 so I suggest that may be we should put this homework before the last one, change the sequence, and I think it will be better.
 I didn't spend a lot of time on this homework, but it's still cover a lot of thing we learned in the previous class, so I think it's helpful.
