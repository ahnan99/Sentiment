I definitely thought this homework was better than the last one. I liked how more of the questions were based on material we covered in class, and felt that some of the questions really enhanced my understanding of the material. However, I also thought that some questions, namely question 1C and question 3C were confusing, and I wasn't sure what type of answer was expected for either question.
