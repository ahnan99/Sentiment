I was pretty frustrated on some of these assignments that I felt should have been pretty simple. Unfortunately, things did not work as they planned. My hadoop wasn't running things on the distributed file system to completion. It took longer than I had hoped. overall, pig is pretty cool though. I am probably going to have to do the optional homework now sigh. sigh. sigh. Why am I doing this review? Hi TAs! I did like the story elements of this homework though. I felt like it would be useful in the real world!
