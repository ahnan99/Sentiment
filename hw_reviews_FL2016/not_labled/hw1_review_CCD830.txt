Overall I feel a small sense of achievement after completing the first homework of this class.
The second problem was difficult but not unreasonable and I was able to come to the (hopefully)
correct answer after some toil and struggle. The article for the third question was a bit over my
head and I had a difficult time comprehending the highly technical article, so that part took longer
than I anticipated.
