While problem 1 was easy and straightforward, the rest weren't. It has nothing to do with the professor and TA's, but the homework materials are simply not covered as throughly as previous ones. Before this homework, most of the exercises were a slightly different version of what we did in labs or what the lecture slides said. This one, however, only showed only the very fundamentals needed and did not show us anything else. Therefore, we had to work with a TA for couple of hours wrestling through what is right and wrong (we later even found out that the code provided for us has some syntax errors and not many essential libraries imported. We still got it done on extension time and I learned a lot.
