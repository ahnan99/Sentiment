Not sure what I felt about this homework. I did it while following the lab instructions, since they were pretty much identical. Didn't realize we had to print stuff to the console in the test; I had thought the tests would print stuff and we had to copy and paste it as an answer. All the projects disappeared from Eclipse and that sucked, had to fix stuff then I imported the three projects we've been using back.
