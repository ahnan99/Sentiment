This homework is a challenge for me since I met a huge difficulty in coding in java to populate hashmap and read lines one 
by one. This is not that related to the mapreduce function but it tests the foundation of my java programming. I learn a lot
from this homework even though it costs me a lot of time, however, I learn more and enjoy during the process.
