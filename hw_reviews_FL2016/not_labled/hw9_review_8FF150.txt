This homework was a lot shorter, and thus more aproachable than a few of
the previous ones. I enjoyed not having to do three seperate compilation
steps just to test. It made development go much faster. It was also cool
to have a mock scenerio to be working under, rather than somewhat 
arbitrary tasks.
