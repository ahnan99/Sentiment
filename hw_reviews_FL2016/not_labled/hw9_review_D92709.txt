I think the firt part of this homwwork is pretty simple because I understan what exactly I should do. Therefore, I feel very happy. However, the second part is difficult to me because, honestly, I did not understand the concept duting t only if I work hard I can find a good job. Then I need to think about how i can balance the study and the relationship with my girlfriend. today I finish hw 4 late again. I feel not good because 1. I did not have a good time plan to do the homework 2. this course is difficult so that I have to pay a lot of time in the homework. It will be the mid exam in two weeks. So I feel upset. I have to study hard and finish hw 5 ealier than the extension. Hope next time I will feel better.
