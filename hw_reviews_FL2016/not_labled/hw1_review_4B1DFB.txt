This week's homework is a little disappointing, largely because of the types of questions asked. Although I realize that we as a class have not delved into cloud computing to much detail, the reading comprehension and "match-the-property-to-the-dataset" questions are laborious and do not stimulate.
In tandem, the probability formula question was inconvenient to answer because I (and possibly others) am not familiar with LaTeX; I'm sure the grader would not be very delighted to read my equation 'format', either. If you have any resources for LaTeX, please link them to your page.

The article itself was a decent read, but the questions that came along with it can be phrased in a clearer manner. There is no specific reference to a 'data-based' approach in this article; please be more granular than that, as students may spend more time than necessary only to misinterpret the question.
