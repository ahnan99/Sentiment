This time we learn to use the ToolRunner and command line to test the MapReduce program locally. We also build the MapReduce program to analyze the weblog data. In the command, we can test the program easier and more convenient because we do not need to modify the source code as well as test the program in different configurations. It is a little bit hard but I handle these tasks successfully.
