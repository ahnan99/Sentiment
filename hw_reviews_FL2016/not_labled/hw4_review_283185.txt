I liked this homework more than any other homework we have done so far. Being
able to use command line parameters is a great thing for mapredeuce. It allows
for more flexability for each job, as shown with the caseSensitive example.
Toolrunner will be useful in the future for more complicated jobs. The log
files are also a very real dataset. That is, they are something that every
developer comes across often and this was a useful exercise for learning how to
analyze these with mapreduce. This class is becoming much more practical as we
progress.
