This homework is a nightmare. It looked pretty straight forward, but when I really tried to imitate the given example, I found it so hard to get a correct result. Basically, I just started my work following the 2-job methods on the slides. The first job worked pretty well, but when it comes to the second job, I just got stuck, and couldn’t get out of it. There must be something wrong with the data structure, but I just couldn’t figure it out before the deadline. I feel so upset about this.
