this homework assignment was pretty fun. I enjoyed testing the different methods that we had learned in class in a real world situation. One thing that was kind of confusing was getting the file nae of the file for the invertedindex program. It was a bit hard to figure that one out but once I did it was actually pretty easy. Overall i give this an average rating for the homework assignment.
