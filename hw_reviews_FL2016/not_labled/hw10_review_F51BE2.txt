i thought this lab was a really cool way to get into apache spark. this is a technology that I always to use, and to get the chance to use it was great. I wish there was better documentation, but I get that this is a new technology so there will be less out there.I believe there was an error on piazza in regards to question 2b, which confused us, but we overlooked it and I believe got it done correctly.
