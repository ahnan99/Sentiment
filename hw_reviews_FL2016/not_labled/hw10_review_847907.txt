I enjoyed this homework a lot, because I think that working with the cluster through Spark is a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of Python, so using pyspark to handle large datasets with transformations and functions has been really interesting for me. I think that I learned a lot from this homework, and I hope that future homeworks are similar to this one with a lot of functional programming.
