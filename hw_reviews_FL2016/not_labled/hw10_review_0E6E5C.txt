In homework 10, we solved a few problems which are related to Spark. I really like Python, so I chose Python with Spark. We used the command line tool - Pyspark in the first two problems. I think they are very helpful for us to understand the Spark functions and do the local tests. In the third problem, we wrote a python problem and run it in the local mode and yarn client mode. It is a very good practical problem for understanding the diffrence of running Spark program in different modes.
