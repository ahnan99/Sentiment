I thought that the homework was a bit confusing - I wasn't sure what type of answer to use to describe the different properties in the first question of the assignment. Later, for the third question, I thought that the questions that were asked about the article were only loosely answered in the article, so I had a hard time connecting the article back to the questions. I did enjoy solving the second problem though.
