This is much easier than the first one. The only problem is that I confused about the improvement. I can't find out what should I write, so I just look through wiki and find some limitation and then disscuss them. Others are not so hard. This is the second time I write MapReduce program, since I graduated from Tsinghua University. Although I almost forget how to write code in Java, I still can get every correct line from Google. And better than first time, this time there are lots of samples for me to understand, so it's much easier.
