Although this homework only have two questions, I learned a lot. We have a good parctice on inplementing ToolRunner for
MapReduce. And experieced the convience it brings to pass parameter from command line. While, although we spent a lot time
trying to figure out what the real mechanism is, we still feel confused. So it would be appreciated, if the Professor could 
spend some time in class on this.
