I got really stuck at some point in the homework when I was trying
to run my partitioner on the hadoop cluster but couldn't seem to
access the file containing positive and negative words. It was
really frustrating since I knew it worked as it worked locally
and on the junit test. Once I figured it out however, it was smooth
sailing the rest of the way. I think in general, the homeworks are
really helpful in making me feel like I understand the material
since I have to implement it.
