Another busy week. So much homework to do. And I have to prepare midterm exam for 427. I am so confused why 427’s midterm is scheduled at first day after fall break. If this, I feel I cannot have a happy fall break.This homework is easier than last one. It’s my first time to submit homework without using extension!
