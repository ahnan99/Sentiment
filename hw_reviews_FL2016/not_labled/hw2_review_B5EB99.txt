This homework is a very helpful practice of the application of MapReduce and also leads me into deep thinking about handling practical problems. Personally I am now much more familiar with the linux commands than the moment before I wrote this homework. It urged me to take a look into the fundamental components of hadoop codes and go through trial and error to solve runtime exceptions. I leant a lot from this homework.
