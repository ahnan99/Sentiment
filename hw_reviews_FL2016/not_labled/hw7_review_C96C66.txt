This homework was significantly more difficult that I expected it to be. Because this was a more theoretical homework, I expected it to be much easier than what I actually encountered. It was definitely tough to connect what we learned in class with what was asked in the MMDS readings because they are so in depth. While I definitely enjoyed learning about this section, I think it could have been beneficial to do one more day in class about this before attempting on the homework.
