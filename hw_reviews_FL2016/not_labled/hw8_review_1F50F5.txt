I really enjoyed this homework. Iâ€™m not sure why, but the recommendation systems make a lot of sense to me and I think they are one of the most interesting things we have covered in class so far. I really enjoyed being able to analyze the data using a software of our choice (I chose excel) because I feel like this is what MapReduce would be used for in practice in the real world. Through implementing the top-N list, we were able to see a little of what Netflix uses on a daily basis.
