Overall I thought this homework improved my understanding of mappers and reducers, especially with regards to their inputs and outputs. I was very confused by 1.c, as i thought the question seemed very unclear. I thought building the driver was very neat, but one thing we did get tripped up on was the import statments. we thought doing * would load all of the files in that folder, but it errored out until we included each file individually. Overall, this definitely improved my knowledge of the material.
