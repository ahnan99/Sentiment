Overall, I enjoyed working on this homework assignment. Problem 1 on Big Data Properties seemed tricky to me, because there could be multiple correct answers, based on the justifications for each category. Problem 2 was difficult and required a lot of thought (and scratch paper!). "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" was an interesting read. The structure of the article was somewhat confusing, but I enjoyed reading about the natural language processing and semantic data problems. The questions asked in Problem 3 helped with my understanding of the article.
