Next week is midterm for 427, I am so anxiety for the midterm. I have to review all the materials and ppt and homework. Since most of homework was done by my teammate, I have too many things to review. Tomorrow I have a in class assignment, and I also got a large assignment for another class. So busy this week! I think it wonâ€™t be a happy fall break for me.
