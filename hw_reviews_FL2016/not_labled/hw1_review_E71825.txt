This homework looks reasonable. It has its first part to enhance our understanding of the concepts that we discussed during the class; the second part to test our ability to derive math equations using probability theories; and the last part for reading a paper. In fact, I had been stuck on the second problem for almost 10 minutes until I figured out what scenario it was talking about (which is a little bit different from the original example).
