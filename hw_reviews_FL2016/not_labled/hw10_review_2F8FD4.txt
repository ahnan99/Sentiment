I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
One look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe this smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidence arose from circumstance
One thing lead to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
telling me what your heart meant
Heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And now you find yourself in 82
The disco hotspots hold no charm for you
You can't cincern yourself with bigger things
You catch the pearl and ride the dragon's wings

It was the heat of the moment
telling me what your heart meant
Heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many night's you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambition you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
telling me what your heart meant
Heat of the moment shone in your eyes

It was the heat of the moment
telling me what your heart meant
Heat of the moment shone in your eyes
