I believe this homework assignment was mediocre. Question 2 was much different and much more difficult in comparsion to the other questions. Also Question 2 seemed to come from way out of left field and I do not recall hearing about Bonferroni’s Principle in lecture. In the flip slide Bonferroni’s Principle seems to be very relavant and should be helpful in the course to come.
