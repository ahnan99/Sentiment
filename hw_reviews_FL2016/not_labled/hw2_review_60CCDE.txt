This homework was significantly harder than the first one, which was expected. Having said that, I really enjoyed this homework because it enabled me to grasp the concepts we have learned so far in class. The hardest part of the homework was definitely coding and running our own MapReduce program on the cloud. While the coding portion wasn't extremely difficult, I definitely had some trouble running the program and ran into a few errors with input and ouput types for my Map and Reduce programs. In the end, with some help from a great TA, I was able to get my program to run successfully and completed the homework. Overall, I really enjoyed the first experience.
