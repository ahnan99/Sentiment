I felt like question one was very useful in teaching us the five dimensions of big data, but other than that it was relatively dry. Question number two was a lot more fun, as it forced me to work through some math but also see that intensive data analysis often leads to inaccurate findings. Unfortunately, I found question number three to be somewhat frustrating as it didn't feel like the questions being asked pertained exactly to the text we read, but the text itself was interesting.
