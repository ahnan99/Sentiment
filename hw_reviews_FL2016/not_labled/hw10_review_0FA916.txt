This homework was tricky, and there is very little documentation of spark on the internet. Once I got the hang out it is was easy, but there was a difficult learning curve. I prefer pig to spark and also prefer hive. Spark is very useful because it allows the use of python which is a very common dynamic language. The most confusing part of the homework was question 2 where we had to split the xml data into indivudal records. I went about this by parsing the entire file and then slitting according to the xml Element data. I'm not sure if this was the intended method, but it got me the correct answers.
