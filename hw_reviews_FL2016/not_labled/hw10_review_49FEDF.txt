I hated this homework with the fire of a hundred suns. There is a difference between assignments that are difficult because they are conceptually difficult and assignments that are difficult for stupid reasons like running into lots of bugs that seem like they shouldn't be a problem and are unrelated to the core concepts being tested/learned by the assignment. I felt that a lot of the difficulty of this assignment came from the second type. Ultimately, I did feel like I learned the concepts, but I also was super frustrated for a lot of hours.
