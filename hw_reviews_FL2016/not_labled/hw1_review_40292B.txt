This homework was weird. I did it in parts, like did question one, took a break, saw question two, skipped to question three, wrote some stuff, saved, and left it there. Then continued two days later. I kinda got question two, but couldn't quite get the magniture right. Feeling pretty lazy in general, this homework feels kind of tedious. I feel like one of those algorithmns scanning through the article for the piece of information the question wants me to extract.
