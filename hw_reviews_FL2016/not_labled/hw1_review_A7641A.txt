This homework was pretty straightforward. It gave me a good understanding of the concepts that we covered in class and it also gave me a good sense of what to expect in future homeworks and possibly on the exam.The second question however was a little confusing to me initially but after discussing with my partner and reading the Piazza post, the concept became much clearer to me. It was a good learning process because the answer wasn't directly obvious to me and I had to do a little bit of research to get to the answer.
