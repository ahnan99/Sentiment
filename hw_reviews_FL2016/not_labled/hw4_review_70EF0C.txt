this homework is really useful, because it improve my understanding about the configuration. Also, through the java programming, such as command line about configuration, i find that eclipse is a really convinient way for us to do the configuration and test program.Actually, i tried three diferent methods for configration in this homework and i think the eclipse is the most convinient and direct way.
