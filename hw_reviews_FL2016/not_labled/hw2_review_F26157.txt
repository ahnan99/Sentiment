Homework 2 proved much more difficult than Homework 1 and made me feel genuinely confused. Moreover, my partner and I are not even sure we can finish the assignment, because our code simply dies when we attempt to run to answer 4c. Neither one of us can find any errors in the code and our logic directly mirrors the content of the slides and the in-class wordcount example. As you can imagine, this is frustrating and concerning for future classwork.
