Wow, that was very comprehensive. I just finished up Homework 4 with my partner and even though it was frustrating sometimes, it really reinforced the concept we're covering in class. I like that we truly are walking through every step of the MapReduce process and implementing more MapReduce programs a lot. It's very helpful to think critically about the problems as well. I am frustrated, however, with the testing process. Specifically in the testing the Reducer. It's really hard to verify that the Reducer is working since we can only supply one input (and therefore only one output). In this case, it wasn't an issue because the Reducer was the same as that in wordcounts, but  for future programs it would be nice if there were a way to more accurately test the MR programs.
