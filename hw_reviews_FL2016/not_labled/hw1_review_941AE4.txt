This homework was relatively hard. The second problem especially made me have to review a lot of concepts taught in 247 and 240. Although I am glad that I had to go through the problem as now I understand how to do these problems. These questions really force you to read the assigned readings which is good because now I am forced to follow along with the class. However, I am scared of falling behind now. Overall, I am excited but nervous.
