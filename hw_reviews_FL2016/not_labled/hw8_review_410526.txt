This time we try to use what we have learned for a real dataset, which is pretty cool! I used a lot of thing that I studied in this class to finish Q1. I think this dataset is interesting. We can use the real data to do more things. Similarity is a pretty good topic as I have studied some recommandation system in my undergraduate. And I'm really excited about study more application for Big Data!
