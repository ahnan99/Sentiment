I did this homework very last minute and thus it kind of stressed me out. However, the last question was delightfully simple and cool. Overall, it was an okay homework assignment. The course materials helped a lot, but this time around it was a bit more ambiguous and I had to do more online searching. Overall, it was manageable, just doing it every week is a pain. Happy days ahead! FALL BREAK IS NEARLY HERE
