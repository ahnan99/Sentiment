This homework assignment was a bit more time consuming than previous assignments but was made worse by the fact that I had to set up the virtual machine on a new computer. In general, I liked the assingment because, similar to the last assignment, it allowed me to actually write and test a full MapReduce program. Additionally, I feel more comfortable with concepts we've discussed in class after completing this homework.
