I thought that the homework was fair, but I panicked a little bit on problem 2. I had not looked at Piazza and as a result had missed the hint given about the problem. I knew that i was correct except for the order of magnitude of my value, but could not get the correct answer. As a result, I felt very flustered and upset before I checked Piazza. However, after I completed the problem, I had no other issues and thought the homework was reasonable.
