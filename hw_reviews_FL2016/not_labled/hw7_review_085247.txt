HW 7 was one of the more involved homework sets thus far. This was my favorite homework set. I really feel like I learned a lot through working on this set. I definitely had to brush up on some of my matrix algebra that I haven’t used in a really long time, so that was part of the reason it was rewarding to finish it — because I felt like I applied matrix concepts that I relearned successfully.
