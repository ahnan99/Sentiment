This homework assignment was extremely time-consuming because it asked us to incorporate everything we did in the previous three labs, and twice. Writing the code was pretty straightforward most of the time, as we had a basis in the slides to reference from, although it did take quite a while to find some things. I definitely am more familiar with running Hadoop programs after this homework.
