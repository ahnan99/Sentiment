This week is so busy. I have to complete cse330’s assignment first since its due is earlier than 427. But there are so many bugs I need to deal with for 330. So I just put too much time in 330. As result, I have to use extension to finish 427’s homework. But 427’s homework is not as hard as I thought. Finally I finish it on time!
