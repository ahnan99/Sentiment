While I believe that spark is very useful and easy way to run HDFS structure and simple commands to create RDD and reduce them. The biggest problem for it was that because it depends on Python or Scala to run the commands and fit them in the stack that is provided to that spark terminal or program, it cannot contain all of them sometimes which leads to some frustrating debugging on local jobs.
