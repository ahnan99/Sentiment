I felt like I learned a lot by doing this homework. There were a lot of hadoop operations that we have covered in previously in homework and labs that I felt like I had a shallow understanding of but now I have a much better understanding. TutorialsPoint really helped me understand combiners and partitioners. We struggled for a little while trying to figure out some of the coding specifics for the third question, but ultimately we got it. Overall it was a little tricky but not terrible.
