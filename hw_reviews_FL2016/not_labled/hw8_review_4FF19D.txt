I thought that this homework was a bit longer than usual. I think I was a little stressed while doing it because I was doing it around the election, so i could not completely concentrate. I thought that there was a bit less guidance than usual, and as a result I had a bit more trouble completing the hw. I did not enjoy coming so close to the deadline.
