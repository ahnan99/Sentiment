I thought that this homework was the most frustrating of all homeworks, but that was due to my own carelessness in not implementing toolrunner correctly. We spent many hours trying to figure out why it couldn't locally add a file, but realized we needed to pass in getConf() into the job creation. I wish that we had figured out this mistake sooner, but the other parts of the homework were pretty easy to work with and I thought were good.
