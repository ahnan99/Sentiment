Overall for this lab, I felt that for number one and three, the questions were quite simple and easy to understand, there wasnÅft much difficulty understanding the material. Number two I thought was quite challenging with the information that we need to obtain and to input. We ran into a few errors while doing the lab which made it pretty frustrating.Overall for this lab, I felt that for number one and three, the questions were quite simple and easy to understand, there wasnÅft much difficulty understanding the material.
