This homework is the hardest one I have met in this course! I felt really stressed when I was doing this homework since I did really a suck job in midterm. I thought I had covered slides and materials professor provided I would not get a bad grade. But I got a D- and the mid term evaluation is C. I was pretty upset and wanted to get a better score in the following 2 months. I really struggled in this homework, those days I was busying with preparing interviews with Amazon, so I missed two lecturers. I could do nothing at the beginning and then I asked some of my friends who had token this course last semester for advice, and that really worked. Especially thanked to my friend Edward, who gave me many informative ideas.
