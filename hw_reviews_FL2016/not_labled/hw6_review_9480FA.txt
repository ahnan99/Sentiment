I actually really enjoyed this homework, it was probably my favorite one yet. It had a strong emphasis on coding, but the coding was more focused on figuring out what to do, instead of reading how to do something from an example. I like this, as it was more rewarding to ultimately figure out how to solve a coding problem.
