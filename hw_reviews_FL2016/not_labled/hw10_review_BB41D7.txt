This homework was fine. It did not take too long and I didn't feel as if I wanted to rip my own beating heart out of my chest as I went through the problems with my partner. Apache spark seems to make a good amount of sense and I enjoy coding in Python, so that was good as well. Overall, I'd give this problem set a B on a regular grading scale.
