The homework is starting to get frustrating because it feels like we don't cover enough in class to actually do the homework.
I usually feel like I don't know what I'm doing and have to guess at how to code. There is not very much online documentation to help with these problems
 and it just feels like the homeworks are rushed through. I don't think I'm learning very much because the lectures are kind of boring and don't seem to relate very well to 
  doing the homework. I hope this changes in the future. 
  
 There is very little clarification on the homework and the labs are only sort of useful for figuing out the homework.
