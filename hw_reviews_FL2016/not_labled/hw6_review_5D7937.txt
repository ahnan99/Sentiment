For this homework, it contains three questions. First one was about compression. I had to make uncompressed output file and compressed output file to compare difference of each file. Then, I had to read compressed output file to text, and identify some signatures in that text. At last, I had to make duplicate driver java file and comment out some lines of code, and use command line options to control compression instead of doing it in java code. Everything was straight forward, and slides were also really helpful. Second problem was about creating inverted index. First, I had to identify kind of InputFormat that can read the input data given, and use codes to retrieve the file name. Then, by implementing mapper and reducer for inverted index, I successfully ran the program in input. Lastly, I wrote down mapper output for two lines of text. Third problem was about word-co-occurrence. I implemented the mapper and driver for word-co-occurrence and used identity reducer. After successfully running that on input data, I answered why this can be problematic. Overall, homework was pretty long, but fun.
