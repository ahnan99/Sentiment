Here we are again! I'm looking through hw5 cos lecture is getting  kinda boring. Lab goes pretty slow cos Professor Neumann tries to make things interactive which gets kinda lame, those active learning shits get pretty annoying. Well I need more words, since for the first time this doesn't break 50 words casually. Oh yay we're there.
