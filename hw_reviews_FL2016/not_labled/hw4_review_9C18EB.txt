This homework has much work than the previous three homeworks. However it was useful too. I have implemented ToolRunner and learned how to pass parameters using command line as well which may save time for later projects. In this homeweork, we worked on a new dataset of a new application other than word counts and average word length which is web log data. I think it was a useful homework, but a bit time consuming.
