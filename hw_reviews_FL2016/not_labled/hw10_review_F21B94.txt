This homework definitely wasnâ€™t the most challenging we have had. It was pretty fun to refresh my Python skills, and this was probably the most challenging part of the assignment because it was hard to get the syntax correct. Once I figured this out and I figured out how to load data to/from HDFS it was a pretty simple assignment. I really enjoyed learning about Scala and how to use it on top of HDFS and MapReduce. I do wish that the lab was written out a little more clearly because it was hard to follow along at some points in the lab and the homework depended on finishing the lab.
