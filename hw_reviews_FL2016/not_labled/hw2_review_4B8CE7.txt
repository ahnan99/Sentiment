This homework was so freaking cool. I finally got to implement a Mapreduce program consisting of a mapper, reducer, and driver. I learned that the input and output classes for mappers and reducers need to be set before running a program, and that the mapper output type should equal the reducer input type. I learned the fundamental steps of mapreduce. I discovered that there are multiple input types requiring different record readers. I learned about basic hadoop filesystem commands, and what a hadoop classpath is. This was also a good review of basic linux commands. I hope that in the next homeworks and labs I will be able to implement more complex and useful mapreduce applications.
