For homework2, there were not any unreasonably hard questions. Every questions required thorough understanding of materials that we covered such as hadoop commands, labs we did in class, HDFS, MapReduce, and so on. Number 1 was straight from lab1 and HDFS slides. Number 2 helped me to understand mapper and reducer inputs and outputs. Number 3 was straight from lab 2 and required some thinking. Number 4 was fun changing some parts of code to calculate average length of shakespeare works.
