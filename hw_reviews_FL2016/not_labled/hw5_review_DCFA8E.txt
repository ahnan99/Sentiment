The homework was pretty good. It takes a lot of online lookups though because the slides and book tend to eschew any specific functions that may be of use in the particular problems.
But again, the homework instructions feature the same unclear writing style like before. If it were not for Piazza clarifications, I may have risked wasting more hours than necessary on this assignment.

I would recommend that you design homeworks more in this manner than the previous four - the primary differentiator being the increased hands-on nature of the problems. But please, please put more comments on the
compareto() method for the StringPairWritable. A working implementation is very easy to implement, but people can get very easily confused about the expected return value.
