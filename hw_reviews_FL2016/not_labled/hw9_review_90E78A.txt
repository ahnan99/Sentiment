I actually really enjoyed this homework. I thought that the method of writing pig scritps makes a lot of sense, so I understood most of the content on the homework, and I also thought the homework was straightforward. Still, I managed to learn a lot as before the homework I had basically no knowledge of how to write pig scripts and now I feel pretty comfortable doing so.
