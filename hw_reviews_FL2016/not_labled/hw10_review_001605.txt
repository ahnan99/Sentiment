In this week, we learn how to user spark to do the data processing work. It is very interesting and useful. I am glad to learn the cutting edge technology for big data applications. Our team choose python for the spark work. From start, we spend some time to read course materials that professor provided. It fully covered the information we need for homework. From syntax to concept. However, while running job in our pseudo cluster, we are not able to open the Hadoop server log information. We asking professor for help and run a script to start the cluster server to see our log information and we finally solve the problem. This week material is very important and I like the light weighted syntax and efficient fashion as Spark for data professing
