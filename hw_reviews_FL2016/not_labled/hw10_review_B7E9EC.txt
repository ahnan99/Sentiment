This homework was very confusing for me. Starting with the lab, a lot of the instructions were not clear. To add to that, I spent so many hours figuring out the directory stuff and that was really annoying. I wish the Cloudera docs were updated to suit our needs before we started working on them. As to the homework itself, I thought it was very challenging.I do have a slightly better understanding of Spark but I spent 90% of my time figuring our repo stuff and how to run commands etc. I only spent 10% of my time with actual conceptual things.
