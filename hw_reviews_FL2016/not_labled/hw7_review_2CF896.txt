More positive about this homework than about the previous. I didn't get the maximum points for previous homeworks, but thankfully the review section brought be back up to 100. So I feel better about this, and I guess writing this review makes me feel good. I liked that this homework didn't have anything that required the VM, it's slow and clunky and I feel like I'm more reluctant to start and do homework when it uses the VM. On the other hand, with VM assignments you tend to know when you have the correct answer. For this homework I feel like I may get more things incorrect just because there is nothing to check my answer against.
