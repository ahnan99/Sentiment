Homework 9 was fun because I learned how to use Pig, which is one of the first non-Mapreduce big data framework applications that we explored in the course. I learned that we should always use a small subset of the data and test locally (such as by using RandomSampler) before submitting to the cluster. I learned about various pig commands including aggregating (sum, count, max), and different ways to group pig relations by attributes. I found that grouping by all can be used to aggregate over the entire data set as a whole. Finally, I learned about how pig can actually be used in the real world for analyzing ad data.
