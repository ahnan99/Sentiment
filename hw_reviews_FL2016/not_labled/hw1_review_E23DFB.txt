The homework for this week was interesting. The first problem was a good test of the various big data terms we learned in the slides. In addition, the second problem introduced an interesting topic regarding the matching of people’s actions to them being possible “evil-doers”. However, I thought the third problem was a little non-specific, as the required text for the problem was long and did not clearly give answers to all parts of the third question.
