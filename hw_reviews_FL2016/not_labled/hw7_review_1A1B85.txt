This homework has equal work to the last one. However it was useful too. We have worked on conceptual level rather than implementing code. We have solved problems about matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix multiplication and figured out how this can be handled using Map Reduce. Some questions were a bit unclear like problem 3.b and problem 3.e I was a bit confused. But in total, I think it was a good homework.
