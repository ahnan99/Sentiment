I was deeply unhappy when working through this particular homework. My partner and I spent countless hours excruciatingly fixing bugs and feeling unsure about our work, particularly in problem 2. If I had to rate this homework, I would rate it abysmally and ask it to leave the building indefinitely to never return.
