This was definitely my favorite homework so far. I liked how it gave me a chance to familiarize myself with writing MapReduce tests. Still, I thought some of the questions, like 4d and 4e, were unnecessary and did little to enhance my understanding of the material. This homework was useful though, as it also helped me learn about the different ways of running MapReduce programs locally.
