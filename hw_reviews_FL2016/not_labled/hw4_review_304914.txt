I really enjoyed this homework because it was the first homework that we had to figure out before we did the lab on the material. This was much more challenging because without implementing ToolRunner in the lab, I completely had to figure it out on my own for the homework. This was initially challenging because I tried to set the configurations in the driver, but after I figured out we had to set the configs in the command line, the homework became much more manageable and I definitely enjoyed it.
