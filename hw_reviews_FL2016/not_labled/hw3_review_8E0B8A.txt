I thought this homework was a good refresher on the lab content from last week. The questions were well distributed among several different topics; the main criticism I might offer is on the choice of topics.
The questions on 'skew', while an acceptable concept to test on, was not hashed out well enough in class. Finding resources on 'skew' definitions is also somewhat difficult.
In addition, while the last two problems were good unit test reinforcements, the instructions for them (particularly ones on 'printing' results) could have been made more clear.
