I thought this homework was good practice for getting a lot of what we discussedthe first week into application. The second problem was a neat equation, and creating the proper formula was fair and good practice for mathmatics. 

I thought the questions for the third problems did not match up very well with the reading. It seemed like the questions needed more information in some areas than the reding gave, and it created a need to guess what the question was truly asking. 

Overall, the first two questions were a very good use of time, and I am glad to have read the article for the third question, I just think the topics could have matched the article a little more closely.
