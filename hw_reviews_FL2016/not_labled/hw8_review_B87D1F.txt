The coding part was very frustrating for a reason I am not sure. I just encountered a lot of errors involving various hadoop packages I hadn't before. Overall though, it was an interesting assignment and I thought it was a good overview of what netflix does. Recommendation systems are a topic I would be interested in looking into in the future. Yay...I am finally done. It was tedious. But oh well. I was also very angsty about doing this homework because of the presidential election but I feel like that's a topic for another time.
