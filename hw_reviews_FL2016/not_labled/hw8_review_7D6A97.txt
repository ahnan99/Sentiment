The first problem seemed very daunting on the first read of it.
However, once I downloaded Mahmoud Parsian's implementation
and understood everything going on in there, there wasn't
too much to do to be honest. Aside from that, I had some trouble
with cosine similarity and its something I probably
need to look into more. I'm also a little unsure if I 
correctly showed 2a correctly.
