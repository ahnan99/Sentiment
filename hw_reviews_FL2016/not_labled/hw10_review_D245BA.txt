i think this home work is really good and useful. it let me have a comprehensive understanding of what we learned in the class.the first problem is about transfering data using spark. the truth is this is my first time to learn what is spark and how to use it. also, this is the first time for me to use python and scala. i use these two languages at the same time in the hw and i learn how to use them. this is hte best news for me. however, writing sparking program and running it is difficult for me .
