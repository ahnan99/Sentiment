i think this home work is really good. it let me have a comrehensive understanding of what we learned in the class.the first problem is about top 15 rating. since i write so many codes for this problem, i leanred a lot about this and how it works. Also, since the professor asks us to plot the distribution of average rating per user, i especially learn how to use spss through the internet and l learn a lot about spss. i enjoy the process of learning new things!
