I felt quite stressed when I was doing homework2. Since this week I had an interview so my partner said he would do homework2 but he did not. When the deadline is coming I found that our homework had not been done yet. Actually I was a little angry, I think one should  fulfill his promise rather than ask me for help when the deadline came, also, answering my partnerâ€™s questions drove me a little mad, most of questions could be solved by himself if he had patience to understand the homework or just google. After all I finished this homework.
