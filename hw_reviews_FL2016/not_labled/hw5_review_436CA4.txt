I found this lab to be very helpful in teaching me about combiners, partitioners, and writables. I enjoyed that almost all of the lab was hands on coding implementation and testing, which helped me grasp the concepts. Although the lab felt long, with a lot of repeat steps for each question, overall I think the lab did a good job with teaching me what combiners, partitioners, and writables are and how to use them.
