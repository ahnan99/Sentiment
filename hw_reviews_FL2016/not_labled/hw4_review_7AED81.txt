This homework was really helpful for me in understanding the concept of ToolRunner. After sitting in lecture and going through the slides, I wasn't quite sure as to what the ToolRunner actually was but once I actually impelemented it I got a good grasp of what it does and how it does what it does. For the second question, it consolidated all the information we had learnt into one question. I thought that was nice because it reinforced a lot of the concepts I had learnt earlier in the semester. Also, I feel moreconfident and comfortale with MapReduce programs now.
