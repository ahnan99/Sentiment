I found this homework to the a good review of hadoop framework we recently learned in class. We were easily able to implement tool runner, although I think we should have experimented with more parameters and options. It was interesting to see how we could use the command line to directly interact with the job, such that we did not have to keep editing the driver file and recompiling into the jar file.
