I thought that this homework was especially long. I had some trouble finding answers within the slides, so that took the most time. I did not enjoy this homework because it was so time intensive. We had to write 3 separate map-reduce programs. In addition, the internet on my virtual machine stopped working which lost me time because I ended up having to copy and paste my files over.
