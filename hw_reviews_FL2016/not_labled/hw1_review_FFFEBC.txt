I thought that the homework was too open ended and asked broad questions, especially on number 3 when it asks about 
the article. I found problem 2 to be very difficult; I spent a lot of time on it but when I finally got it I 
realized it was pretty intuitive. And number 1 helped with understanding the big data dimensions but the slides 
from class and the piazza answer to what complexity and labels were gave varying answers so I was not all too sure
 about what to put.
