i think this home work is really good and useful. it let me have a comprehensive understanding of what we learned in the class.the first problem is about finding low cost sites. through this problem i directly learned about what is the pig and how it works. also, since i did lad 5 for this homework, i learn aboutpig for etl and how to nalyze data from internal and external sources. and Multi-Dataset operations with Pig is another important part of this homework
