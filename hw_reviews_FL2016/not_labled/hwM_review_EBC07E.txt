I had to do the makeup homework because we messed up hw7.
This homework was not too hard. I initially had a problem finding a large enough sample size where the data was sensinble enough to test locally.
I was frustrated at time because pig's syntax is not the most intuitive.
The questions were pretty easy to understand and I knew what was being asked of me so that was nice.
Overall, pretty easy homework, but somehwat frustrating at times.
