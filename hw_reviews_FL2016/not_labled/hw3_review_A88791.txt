This homework assignment was my favorite so far. I enjoyed the in depth use of the virtual machine and the coding. The two questions involving the virtual machine reenforced my knowledge of this week's lab and offered me the ability to implement the concepts on my own. Additionally, the written response questions were generally fair and drew upon the lecture material.
