This homework took too damn long. I'm tired and hungry and this homework didn't make me feel good. sigh. anyway, it was okay, the instructions could have been more informative or less ambiguous. I felt that the concepts that were central to this homework were only spent a little time in class. Oh well. It's done and I feel good about it. I guess I did like how it was more implementation-based. Still, wish it could have been more clear.
