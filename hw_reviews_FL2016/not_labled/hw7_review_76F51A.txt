For this assignment, I thought that the hw was pretty straightforward. Assuming you understand how to matrix multiply, the process of the MapReduce is rather simple and pretty neat.
It's quite interesting how you can split the matrix into separate lines. For the book questions, most of them were simple, last part of problem two was a little tricky because of how the question was phrased.
