This homework did a good job of taking what we learned in class and actually having us use it. At the same time I never felt overwhelmed during this homework which was good. Having the word count code to look at while creating the average word length map and reduce functions made it a lot easier and was really helpful.As an aside I think it's really cool how we've learned how to use hadoop already after only a few weeks in this class. Can't wait for what's next!
