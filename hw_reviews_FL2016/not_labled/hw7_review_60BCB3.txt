This time, I do the hwk7 late again. BTW, I did very bad in mid exam. The reason is that I did not listen the class very well. It was my bad. Therefore, I decide to go to the class of 427 every time and no skip class. I think, only if I work hard I can find a good job. Then I need to think about how i can balance the study and the relationship with my girlfriend. today I feel so bad because I find that I can not find a job if I do this again. so, I need to buck up and make myself a chance to be a better man, then my parents and my girlfriend will be happy again.
