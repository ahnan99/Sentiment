This homework was probably the least helpful to me overall. I found the slides and class notes to be very unhelpful, and this lab was a lot of 'bouncing around' google trying to look for solutions to problems I didn't fully understand. Also, the piazza answers were very vague and did not help me understand the problem and better. I understand that we're supposed to figure things out, but I believe it is okay to be stuck on something, and asking for help only to hear "this is part of the problem you need to figure out" is a bit frustrating.
