Homework 6 was cool because I learned about SequenceFiles and File compression. I learned about the speed and compression ratio between different compression Codecs, such as Snappy, GZip, and Bzip2. Snappy is the fastest compressor, but does not compress as much. Because it is splittable when used with a sequence file (using sync points), however, it is usually the preferred method of compression when analyzing Mapreduce programs. I also learned how to create an inverted index, and compute word co-occurrence. When computing word co-occurrence, input splits need to be considered with respect to the boundaries of records (do not want to split in the middle of a sentence).
