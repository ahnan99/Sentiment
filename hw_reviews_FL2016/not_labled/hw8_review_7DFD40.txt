I thought we were incredibly unprepared for this lab. things like use of excel is now something we should know hpw to do. also there was a massive jump in complexity of this assignment and this made this assignemnt far more work than any other so far. it is very frusterating to be so lost and talkint to other students I do not think we were the only one. better instruction and more specific examples would be very important.
