this homework requires a lot math knowledge which I used to learn from my freshman year. I have not reviewed math for totally four years! I am not so good in math so it took me quite a long time to go over the math. You know doing homework in weekend is not a pleasure haha. And my partner also felt it was hard to solve the problem3, but finally he made it. Yesterday I was watching the American Election, however, I have no right to vote. If I can vote, I would vote for Xi jinping. Letâ€™s make a great China.
