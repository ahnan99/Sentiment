This time we review the PIG again. That's interesting that all these questions actually can be run locally well. So when I face the problem about the data preparation in problem2, I just use the data and run the PIG script locally. And I can find the answer as well. The only thing I need to change is the LOAD part. And I just think I like SPARK very much, maybe I will try my best to do the project 3 as my final project.
