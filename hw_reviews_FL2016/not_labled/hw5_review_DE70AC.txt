Doing the sentiment analysis home work was pretty cool because now I know how to cheat the system.
I can add positive words like happy but use them in a context where they are negative like using the words not happy instead of the single word unhappy
Its unclear that you will be able to get the sentiment of the class at the end of the semester, especially if you have home work reviews like these.
