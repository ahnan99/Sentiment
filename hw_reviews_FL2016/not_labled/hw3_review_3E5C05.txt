This homework was much less intresting than the last homework. I think this is because we had to write unit tests, and I hate writing unit tests. I would much rather be writing actual map reduce jobs than having to write the tests. The tests are pretty repetative, but of course are essential to any good programs. How can you be sure that a job will run correctly on a hadoop cluster, especially a large cluster or large dataset, when you haven't tested it! In the long run testing is key and will same the programmer a lot of time when trying to debug code and isolate specific problems. Running jobs locally helps with this as well because you can see almost instantanious feedback without having to wait for the job to finish running on a large cluster.
