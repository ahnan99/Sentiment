I spend a lot of time to figure out this homework but learn a lot. There are three questions that each of them cover one topic and all of them are meaningful. The problem two took me some time for a bug in partitioner configurations. From start, I use string as a path directory for negative word and positive word dictionary. However, when I run the job while add those two files into distributed cache, cluster canâ€™t find that two files. Later I realize that I should use File data type to process this two files and then works file. It is tricky but I learn more about configuration and job runner settings as well.
