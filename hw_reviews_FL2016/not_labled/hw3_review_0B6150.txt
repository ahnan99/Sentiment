This week I was so busy because I have an Amazon OA in Monday, so I decided to use extension again. However, when I started to take the OA Monday afternoon, I found the account Amazon provided to me is not mine. I reported this error to Amazon but they said they were waiting for the update. I was worried. I really want to get this job, so in this homework I just want to solve those problems as quick as possible.
