I enjoyed working on this homework assignment a lot more than homework one. The coding component in problem four was fun and makes me understand how hadoop works more thoroughly. Debugging was a little harder than regular programs, and overall it was still good exercise. The other problems were also ok in terms of difficulty and it was a good assignment that reinforces my knowledge of the material learned recently.
