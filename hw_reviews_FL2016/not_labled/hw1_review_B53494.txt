The first two problems are quite easy. First problem only need to give some reasonable evidence to convince others that the answer is true, so I don’t worry it. Second problem is about calculating. It’s the easiest thing for me. But the third problem is quite hard to find the answer. I even can’t find any answers after the first time I read it! I tried to search the key words in the question, but failed. So I have to guess what each question is really asked about. It’s really time consuming.
