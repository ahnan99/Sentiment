This homework was by far the best homework we have had. It wasn't too hard, it didn't take too long to complete, and it really expanded
my knowledge of the subject of Pig. At the end of this homework, plus the lab, I feel like I could write an actual piece of code in Pig by
myself and have it run successfully, which is something the previous homeworks have failed to do. The only problem with this homework and the lab
is that a few of the pieces of code do not work and need to be edited so they run correctly. This should not be the case, and the homeworks should be 
checked for that. Other than that, great homework,
