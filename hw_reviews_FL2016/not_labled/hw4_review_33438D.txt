The Toolrunner is a pretty interesting thing for this week. Firstly, I use the slices on the class to finish the problem1, and then I try to use it the same way for the problem2 in order to run mapreduce locally. Then I find that it doesn't work! Then I search a lot in the Internet and find that I'm focus on the set up too much, I even don't need setup in this situation! After that I think I'm fimilar with Toolrunner now.
