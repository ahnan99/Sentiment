Because all the problems were wholly different, this homework made me learn a lot but also made me spend a lot of time. The first problem was our typical homework. We setup the MapReduce using Java code, compile it, and run it on a pseudo cluster machine. This step wasn't too bad except for the debugging portion as it consisted mainly with just coding. While the second problem was a new setup that required us to mathematically prove something, it wasn't difficult either. Problem three was the most helpful of them all because it made us go through an example problem and answer it step by step.
