This homework was the easiest of the homeworks so far.  I think it has something to do with the content being SQL-like. Regardless, I find the content to be quite similar to database content that I have learned before in other classes, and the new concepts are not particularly challenging either.  I had some difficulties with the JVM malfunctioning, but once I merely restored the JVM to an old snapshot, all was well.
