I felt like this assignemnt was very long and cumbersome.
It contained good knowledge, sure, but I didn't get any pratical experence
relative to the class content when building sets and parsing files. That
was annoying, to say the least. Otherwise, it was cool to see how everything
fit together, but I would have rather it have been a singale coheasive assigment,
instead of 3 seperate tasks that weren't really related to each other.
