I don't have much to really say about this homework. Problem 2 was kinda hard to explain. At least in part A it seemed like I was like "well, here it is, here is what it is normalized, look, they look the same". Don't know if that works or not. The rest seemed easy enough to handle, though my partner handled most of problem 1 and 3 so he may have gotten the hard parts.
