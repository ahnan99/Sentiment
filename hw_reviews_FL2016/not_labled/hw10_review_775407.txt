This hw was rather challenging since it was new to me and the TAs. I usually am able to ask the TAâ€™s questions and they answer right away but since spark was not covered last year the TAs had some difficulty with this HW as well. I had some difficulty using python for importing the XMLs and I am still not sure what went wrong with that step but using scala it went fine.
