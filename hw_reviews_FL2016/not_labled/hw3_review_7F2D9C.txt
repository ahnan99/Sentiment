This homework is interesting. It take me a lot of time when I finish the last time's homework since I 
need to change the path of output file and input file every time, at that time I was looking forward 
to learn about testing my program locally, and it comes this time! Testing program is not very difficult
and I'm now a little bit curious about next lecture. I am waiting for it.
