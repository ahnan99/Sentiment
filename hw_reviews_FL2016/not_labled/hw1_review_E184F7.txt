At the beginning it doesn't seems hard for me. Problem 1 is just the application of big data's 
property, which has been annotated by the professor in the class. I'm not feeling good when I solve 
problem 2. I have no idea at first. But when I discuss with my partner I can find the solutions. 
problem 3 is not hard, too. To conclude, when I finish the homework I feel I can understand what the
big data is and I can relate them more closely with what I learned in class.
