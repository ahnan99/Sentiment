This homework was a little more frustrating than the previous one because it required spending more time doing set up. The set up can get annoying because it is a little tedious and I donâ€™t always know what I am doing, just that is required for the program to run. Again it was useful to have the lab correlate with the homework so that are have a framework and can practice coding tests.
