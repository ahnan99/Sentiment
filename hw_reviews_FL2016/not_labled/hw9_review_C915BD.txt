Pig Latin is an intresting programming language that is unique from any other language I have used before. It reminds me the most of SQL and operates in a similar manner to a relational database. This homework was pretty straight foward, however I had inconsistancies in my answers. My scripts were very sensitive to change so I hope I tuned them correctly. This was amuch better than the last homework because it was much shorter and Pig Latin is easy to write. I am excited because there are very few homeworks left and we are almost to the final project!
