I found this homework particularly frustrating because it built off the lab. My group had a very difficult time finishing the lab during class time and ended up running into errors without being able to put the data into HDFS. Therefore, we were unable to do the homework for quite some time until the error was fixed. In the future, I hope that the homeworks don't quite rely so much on getting the lab 100% correct because this experience was very frustrating. In terms of the actual homework, it wasn't very bad at all because Pig is very intuitive and I enjoyed that aspect of it.
