This homework assignment was particularly time-consuming because it tested our knowledge of the Hadoop platform, which is a completely new concept that takes a while to get used to. Writing the code was okay, as we had a basis in the slides to reference from. Overall, I think I learned quite a bit from hands-on programming a MapReduce, as applying it to a real task helped me grasp its concept.
