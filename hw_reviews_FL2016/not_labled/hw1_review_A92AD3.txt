First, I think the review is a great way to talk back about the homework and I appreciate the chance you give us. 
As of this homework one, the first thing I want to say is it takes a lot more time than I expected. Especially, problem 3 comsumed a lot time, I read it more than 3 times and it's kind of difficult to extract and summerize the infomation to these 3 questions.
