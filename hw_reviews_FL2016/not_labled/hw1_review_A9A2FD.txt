I thought that Problem 1 was a little vague but easy, Problem 2 was unnecessarily confusing and wasn't actually very helpful, and Problem 3 was interesting and helpful. Overall, I thought that this homework could have been a bit more focused and relevant, and that completing it took more time than it needed to.
