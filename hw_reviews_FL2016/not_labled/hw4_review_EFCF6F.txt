It is a hard job for me. In the previous homework I didn'   t take a lot of time to complete, but this time
I took five hours to complete. The second problem is so great that it combines all the knowledge we have 
learned. Maybe it will become a good review material for me. Although the hw4 is a little bit difficult, 
it help me understand the hadoop deeply.Looking forward to the next time's homework!
