I think that there were some parts of HW2 that wasn't exactly explained too well in class: for example, I'm still a bit confused by what an actual example of metadata is, although we tried to explain it as best we could. I found the programming part enjoyable, but there are still some HDFS concepts that I think I could understand better. I enjoyed writing the mapper and reducer functions although I wish we could more easily test our programs using eclipse, although I know that eclipse is not configured with hadoop.
