I wasnâ€™t able to finish this homework on time due to time constraints. I finished problem 1 and thought that the instructions were a little confusing and unclear at time. Problem 2 I read and went over but did not implement. Problem 2 seemed like there were a lot of pieces to it and it seemed a little complicated to do.
