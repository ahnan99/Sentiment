This homework was challenging like most of the other homeworks in figuring out how to actually implement the code through the Hadoop library imports. Once that is out of the way, the rest is relatively straightforward as we have done it multiple times already and are already plenty familiar with the environment. I learned more ways to implement MapReduce after this homework assignment.
