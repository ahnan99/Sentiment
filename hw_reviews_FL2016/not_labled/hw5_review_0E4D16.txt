Homework 5 had unclear questions that made me feel genuinely confused. Moreover, my partner and I are not even sure we can finish the assignment, because we cannot run an important part of it - at least not in such a way that meest our standards. Neither one of us can find any errors in the code and our logic directly mirrors the content of the slides and lab. As you can imagine, this is frustrating and concerning for future classwork.
