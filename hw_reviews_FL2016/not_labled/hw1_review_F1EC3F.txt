In general I did not mind this homework assignment very much. The first question, describing the properties of each big data problem, was subjective but fairly straightforward and allowed me to justify my answers. The second problem involving probabilities was more difficult and I had to attend office hours in order to correct my solution. The third question involved learning about applying big data availability specifically to natural language which I found interesting, but a bit too abstract at this point in the class.
