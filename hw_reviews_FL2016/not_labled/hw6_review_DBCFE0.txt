HW6 seemed difficult but not unnecessarily so. I did a lot of the work on the sequenceFile and File Compression Problem and got a little bit stuck on some of the syntactical thing. However, the hints that were given from the professor helped a little bit. There was definitely some unclear directions that led to me feeling unsure about what was being asked even though I felt like I knew the problem and what was going on. As a result I probably included more information and had a less focussed answer than is ideal.
