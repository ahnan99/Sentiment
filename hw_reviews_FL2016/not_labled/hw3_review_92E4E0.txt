This homework is designed very well. It is very well considering the concepts and implementation of a map reduce job. To finish this homework well, I go over some of the slides in the lecture and read some extra online readings.Also, this homework touches some knowledge that we didn't have time to deal with in lab, like run a job locally through command line. Overall, I rank this home work 4 stars(5 in total)
