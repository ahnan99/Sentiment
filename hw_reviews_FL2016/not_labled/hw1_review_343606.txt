Homework 1 was manageable. Having no experience in machine learning, databases, or cloud computing, it was encouraging that the concepts weren’t too complicated to understand. The first problem was straightforward and enjoyable since we did an example in class via a quiz question. Having done a similar problem in class made me more confident in my answer. The second problem was difficult for me. It was hard to understand what equation to solve for since an example wasn’t done in class. I liked reading the article for the third question. Overall, it was a positive experience.
