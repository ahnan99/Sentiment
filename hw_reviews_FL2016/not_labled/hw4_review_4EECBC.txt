The fourth homework provided some annoying syntactical/command issues that held us up for longer than they really should have. They seemed like simple issues, but - among other things - we had trouble getting the command to run the ToolRunner locally to work properly. I did really like how the second problem was broken down into the program development flow of starting small and incrementally adding things to your source code and incrementally using larger and more real data sets with your final algorithms. That made it feel like a real world problem that we were solving and developing a solution for.
