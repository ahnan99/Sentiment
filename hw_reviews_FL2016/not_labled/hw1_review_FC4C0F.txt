Homework 1, while not overly difficult, made me feel genuinely confused. To be frank, I found the book/article dense and not the most immediately informative, and this made Questions Two and Three less straightforward. On the other hand, the subjective aspect of Question One is both encouraging, since we are given the chance to justify our findings, and discouraging, because of the lack of an absolute answer.
