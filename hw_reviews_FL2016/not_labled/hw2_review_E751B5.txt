I guess this homework was kinda frustrating, I wanted to get stuff done asap, and I got the lab working but then I turned my VM off, and once I did I realized that I needed it for the homework. But when I turned it back on submitting the mapreduce job no longer worked. So that was pretty annoying. Plus if I went back to school I could technically make it for office hours, but I just got home and took a shower... Got it done in the end, though.
