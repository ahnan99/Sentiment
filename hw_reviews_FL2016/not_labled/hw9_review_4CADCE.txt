This week, homework 6 grade is up. I am disappointed that we don’t get the bonus point and it is because I don’t implement a real java program. According to this homework, it takes some time because we start to learn a new techniques called PIG. We learn the basic idea and operation in LAB 5 instruction. But we still need to do a lot of google search for command in either PIG script or in HDFS for data retrieving. But this technique is very important. We used to struggling in Map Reduce job for data retrieving and pre-processing. But within Pig, we can do the same thing in a more simple command. It is like a user friendly version data processing tool for cloud computing job. I like this new technique very much. Since we know the essence of Hadoop MapReduce, I think there would be more such tools can simplify the building process.
