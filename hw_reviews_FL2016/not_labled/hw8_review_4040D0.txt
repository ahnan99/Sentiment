This homework was pretty annoying. I liked using the real netflix data and seeing what we could do with it so the first part of problem 1 was fine. However, the second part was dumb. We're in a class about hadoop mapreduce so why would we be expected to do something outside of that. Why not give us another problem that actually uses the stuff we've been learning all semester? There's so much more we could do to the netflix data with mapreduce so I think it would have been better if we did that.
