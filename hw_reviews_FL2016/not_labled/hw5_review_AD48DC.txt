I thought this homework was very long and kind of hard to understand at first. It took me a long time to understand what I should be doing. However, once I figured it out most of the steps were pretty simple.  One thing that never really made sense to me is why we were supposed to set up to use the Distrubted Cache first and then test after that when we couldn't use just the filepath names. I had to modify my code anyway to provide the full path to the files in order to run my tester.
