I think this homework was not too bad, but it was a lot of coding, and kind of lengthy. I liked how we did not have to write similar codes for all parts, but rather only need to implement parts of the files that we are not familiar with. I also thought the instructions for problem 3 were not too clear, as I was a little confused about the left and right member variables of the StringComparable class. But overall, I think this homework was not too hard and was a good assignment.
