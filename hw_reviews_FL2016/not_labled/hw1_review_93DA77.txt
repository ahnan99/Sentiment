This homework was generally alright, but I don't feel like it
reinforced a lot of the core class ideas for me.
Problem 1 was indeed directly related to class materials, but was so 
subjective that it was hard to navigate. Problem 2 felt a little useless,
given that we should already understand the core concepts from the reading.
I really enjoyed the fact that you gave us a table to check our function
with, however. That was nice. Problem 3 felt like one of those "did you do
the reading" assignments, which reminded me of the 3rd grade. But the reading
was very interesting, so that was good. The questions themselves seemed 
pretty opened ended through, and there weren't exactly direct solutions in
the provided text.
