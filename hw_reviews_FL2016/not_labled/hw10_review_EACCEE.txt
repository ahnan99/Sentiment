This homework was quite interesting. There were some problems with Spark but then once we got it going,
doing everything that we used to do with Map Reduce within a few lines was very cool. Problem 1 took
really long time to figure out because of all the commands. Problem 2 was good, it was interesting and
doable. Problem 3 was not difficult but then we were having a hard time to figure out some of the
problems.
