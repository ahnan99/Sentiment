This time I felt like this homework gave very little instructions on how to go about doing the operations. I felt very lost at times on which commands I should use. I felt like googling almost everything was basically required for this homework. Either that or going to TA hours. Typically I think that a homework should be able to be done completely by yourself but this was definitely not the case for this week’s homework.
