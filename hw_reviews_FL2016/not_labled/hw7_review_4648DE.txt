Homework 7 includes matrix multiplication and PageRank problems. The first one is a very practical problem about the usage of strips in matrix-vector multiplication. The third question is about the matrix-matrix multiplication and it helps us understand how MapReduce job works when doing matrix multiplication. We also learn communication costs from both of the two questions. The second question is about PageRank and I wrote a small program to do the matrix calculation.
