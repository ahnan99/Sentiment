I think the homework wasn't too bad although it seemed a bit hard for the first homework of the semester.
I don't think I would have gotten question 2 without the piazza hint posted. And I also felt questions 1
and 3 were a bit too open-ended leaving me with a feeling of uncertainty and unsatisfaction which I
generally feel after I complete homework. Of course, there's also the possibility that I'm already not
getting the material super well, but hopefully that's not the case.
