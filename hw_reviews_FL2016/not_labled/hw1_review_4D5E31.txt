I really enjoyed this first homework because I was able to apply the techniques we learned in the textbook as well as in class. The article we read by Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira was extremely interesting and a problem I had never thought about before. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about their work and to apply their thought process to what we have been learning about in class. While this was only the first homework, I look forward to learning more throughout the semester.
