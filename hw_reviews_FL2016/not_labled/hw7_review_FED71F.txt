The homework was definitely more challenging than the other one because this required just the mathematical computation skills rather than coding. It was rather more difficult to get your mind around it because all we talked about was theoretical perspective of all of these matrix multiplication. I think doing some example by myself cleared up a bit, but I am still not entirely sure if I was correct when I was going through it.
