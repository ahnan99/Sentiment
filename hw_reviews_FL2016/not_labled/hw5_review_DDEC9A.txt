This homework assignment involved a lot of adding components to existing MapReduce setups. I enjoyed this because writing new programs from scratch can be tedious and involves a lot of duplicating code from previous assignments. This format allowed me just to focus on the new concepts. I especially enjoyed the partitioner part of the assignment which allowed for some interesting control over the job execution.
