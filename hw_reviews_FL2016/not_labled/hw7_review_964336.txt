This homework (Homework 7) was very confusing and complex. After receiving my grade from Homework 1, I’m worried that I’m going to get points taken off for doing things that aren’t mentioned / clearly stated in the problem. To be honest, I’m feeling a little hopeless about my grade in the class already. But then I felt better after getting Homework 2 and Homework 3 back, so hopefully it’s okay. It was actually fun, but still long. I worry that I don’t really understand the material even though I was able to do the homework—some of it felt like just plugging work in. In addition, I felt like class / lecture this week was honestly pointless. I go, but I don’t learn anything.
