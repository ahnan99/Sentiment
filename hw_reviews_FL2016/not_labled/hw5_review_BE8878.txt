This one had a bit too many parts. Not too much more. Maybe it would have just been helpful to have a bit more hints/information on how to program certain things. I didn't have a whole lot of time to finish this with a super busy weekend but was able to finish it. Just not fininsh it until Wednesday, unlike my previous homeworks that I finished 2 full days prior.
