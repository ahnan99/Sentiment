This time we studied about combiner, partitioner and custom writable. It seems that combiner and the last one is quite easy to understand, because combiner is just like a reducer in the mapper. Although some of reducer can’t be used as combiner directly, we can combine the custom writable with combiner to achieve the goal. And the partitioner is quite hard. Firstly, I have to admit that I’m not familiar with Eclipse, so I spent a lot time on the test part to find the distributed cache. And also I need to remember some knowledge about file input and output. What’s more, logging is a pretty interesting tool.
