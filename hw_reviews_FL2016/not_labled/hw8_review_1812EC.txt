I thought this homework was a good review of the topN algorithm. By coding both map reduce jobs required to do the topN function through map reduce, I was able to get a clear understanding of how exactly it is performed. It was interesting to see how the program calculated the top N netflix films. In addition, by writing out the mapper and reducer inputs and outputs for the collaborative filtering in problem 3, I was able to get a clear understanding of how that is done on a very detailed level.
