This homework was really fun because I learned about how to optimize mapreduce programs through using combiners, partitioners, and I also wrote my own custom writable. I thought it was really cool how I created my own sentiment analysis program that I could apply to real big data. Its interesting that shakespeare was such a negative author. Its interesting how combiners do not always speed up programs. Sometimes the overhead of combining within the mappers outweighs the reduction in running time by combining values for a single key. This happens when there are not many keys that could be combined before hand.
