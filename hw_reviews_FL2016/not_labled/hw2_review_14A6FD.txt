The homework was a helpful continuation of Lab 2, which was useful for the introduction to Hadoop. I enjoyed the final coding portion in question 4, especially because it was pretty straightforward. The sentiment analysis question was more confusing; the Wikipedia article was not very helpful. Overall, this assignment took longer than expected. Running Eclipse in the VM was also painfully slow.
