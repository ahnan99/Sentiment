The homework was as expected for a first homework. I felt the first question was helpful to go over key terms that we learned in class, but the hardest question was by far number 2, which I felt should have been worth more points. Overall, I liked the content of the homework and I think others should follow the same scheme, but maybe with harder questions worth more and easier questions worth less points.
