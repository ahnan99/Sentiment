This was definitely my least favorite homework assignment so far in the course. It was centered around matrix algebra which I am not at all familiar with and is not listed as a prerequisite of the course. As such, I thought this in depth use of matrix knowledge was unfair. Additionally, this homework assignment did not involve any implementation using the virtual machine which is usually my favorite part of the homework.
