The design of homework 2 is great! It connects the previous labs and lecutures very well. So it helps to review the contents in labs and lectures. Also it asked some questions related to linux command line, which provides a good chance to get familiar with linux command line. Overall, I rate this homework design to five stars, with five stars in total.
