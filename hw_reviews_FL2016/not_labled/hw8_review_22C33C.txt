I thought that problem 1 was incredibly difficult. We had not gone over Pig in class before, and were expected to use it to solve problem 1b. It took me a considerable amount of time, and was very difficult. We also did not go over graphing software. I thought that problem 1a could have been a little less copy and paste focused as well, I barely had to change any of the source code to get it to work.
