For this homework, it contains three questions. All of them except the first problem did not have any serious implementation of matlab codes. First one was the one that took really long. I had to modify given Top N List MapReduce codes, which is divided into two different job phases. I made changes to ignore user_id and parse correctly. Then, using ToolRunner, I used data from districuted cache to construct hashtable for movie_id and movie_names. Then, I used MATLAB to generate plot for distribution of average ratings per users. Rest two problems were straight forward math problems. The second question was concept related and really straight forward with intuitive answers. The last question was about Collaborative Filtering in MapReduce. Given data, I had to compute mapper output, reducer input and output in collaborative filtering for cosine similarity. Overall, homework was pretty long, but fun.
