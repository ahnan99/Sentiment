I think HW9 was one of the easiest homework sets that weâ€™ve had thus far. However, despite it being easy I felt that I learned just as much if not more than I did after other homework sets. Further, the material I learned seemed very applicable to my interests and what I might want to do professionally after graduation. I think this homework helped me realize that I might actually be interested in a computing career that focuses on business applications.
