For this homework, it contains four questions. I had to use a sample data generated from lab5, so I had to finish the lab first to actually start on the homework. I struggled because the path was not right for a few times. However, using pig with commands was not that difficult. All the commands were straight forward and easy to learn. I had to find four lowest cost sites, three highest cost keywords, total counts, and maximum cost expected. Except the pig took so long to run the scripts, everything else was pretty easy. Overall, homework was pretty long, but fun.
