what a pity. I finish hw 4 late again. I feel not good because 1. I did not have a good time plan to do the homework 2. this course is difficult so that I have to pay a lot of time in the homework.Therefore, I feel very happy. However, the second part is difficult to me because, honestly, I did not understand the concept duting the class. I feel frustrated when I do these problems. By the way I use the extension again, which makes me feel hurry because I have another homework to due. I think I will feel better if I start the homework ealier.
