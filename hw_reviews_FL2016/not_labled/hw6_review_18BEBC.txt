this is a very hard work for me, especially because I have to study for the midterm this week, and I don't have lab for this part of homework.
the worse thing is I missed the due day because I thought it would dued on Wed day, since we don't have classes on MOn. I'm glad that we can have 2 day's automatically extension, otherwise I may have a lot of credit loss in this assignment.
again, I wish I could have a partner for the projects.
