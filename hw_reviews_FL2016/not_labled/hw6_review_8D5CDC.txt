This homework is very helpful for me to enhance my understanding of setting up map only job, generating compressed/uncompressed sequence file, KeyValueTextInputFormat and how to get the filename in the Mapper or Reducer. The first problem is straight forward, and it didnâ€™t take me too long to come up with the answer. The second one, however, did take me much time to figure out that I made a mistake when setting up the class to read the data (I used TextInputFormat at first, and then the task kept failing as it requires LongWritable as the input key of the Mapper). Fortunately, I finally figured out the correct class should be KeyValueTextInputFormat and then everything is done. The final problem is easy as it is almost the same as WordCount except the key is the combination of two words.
