We spend a lot of time in this chapter for matrix calculation. Also, we have taken a lot of time in readings since we need to cover a lot of theory and application side study the same time. This chapter is heavy loaded but I am glad that I learnt one key concept in the cloud computing area, the page rank techniques. With all my understanding, Iâ€™d love to apply those knowledge into real implementations to see how those techniques can help us to create a good recommendation system.
