I spend some time in this homework. But the work load is way small comparing to homework 1 because we don’t have heavy reading workload. I spend some time to understand sentimental analysis that bring me into a new work about pattern analysis and machine learning thinks. Also, I spend some time to review course materials about hardware structure of cloud computing. What’s more, I have a lot practice on hadoop implementation in Java from this homework which I am very interested for a long time.
