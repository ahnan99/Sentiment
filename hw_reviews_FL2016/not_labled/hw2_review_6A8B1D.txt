The homework was deceptively easy after getting the hang of what you are supposed to do. Because I missed one lecture, there were some confusions in the beginning but as my partner and I looked at the lecture slides, it began to come together. The only one that look a longer time was problem four that made us to code the function for mapper, driver, and reducer. Frankly, all the hard part (the configuration and input output parameters) are given and done thus all we had to do was add 2 lines due to the discrepancy with mapper output and reducer output. All in all, I enjoyed the homework and learned quite a bit from it.
