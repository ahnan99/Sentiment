I really enjoyed this homework, much like the last one, because of all of the coding that was in this homework. The emphasis on coding in the recent homework helps me to much better learn to apply the material, which is something that I really appreciate. I especially enjoyed learning about how to use partitioners - I anticipate this will be a useful skill to have!
