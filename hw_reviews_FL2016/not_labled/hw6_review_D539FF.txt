This was a tough one. It took the most amount of time as well as effort and was still very difficult to figure out.
Problem 1 looked doable but some parts like uncompressing and writing into text file were confusing.
The instructions could have been clearer, no disrespect. We also had a very hard time figuring out which slides to refer.
