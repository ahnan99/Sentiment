	I thought this homework was way too hard, and took way too long. Just the first problem itself took hours and hours to understand and complete. If these homeworks are going to be weekly, they are going to have to be much quicker and easier. I don’t understand how you can assign something like this and then complain that people are always taking the extension until Wednesday, since there is no way we can keep up to speed with something like this.
