The last homework is so hard! Maybe I did not catch the professor clearly in the lecture, I did not know use which API in Spark doc to solve the problem. I think the logic is not too hard, but I can not find the API. I asked my friends for help but they do not know the answer either. The only thing I can do is try all possible answer. It really took a lot time. I think this Thanks-giving break is also busy for me since I have to prepare interview. I want a job.
