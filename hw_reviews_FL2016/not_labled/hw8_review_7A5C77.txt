Back to homework again. It really sneaks up on you, especially with the late deadline, homework being due on Monday and no office hours over the weekend. Usually I think I get started on Thursday, but then run into problems on Friday, and since there are no office hours don't end up submitting till Tuesday night. And since I just submitted a homework I don't get started on the next one till the day after, and bam - the next deadline is here.
