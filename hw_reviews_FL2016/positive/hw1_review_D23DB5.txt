I learned a lot in this homework. It helped me to understand different categories of big data and how to approach and observe big data. I also got the chance to brush up on my math and probability skills in problem two, where I got to derive a generic formula for evildoers based on a manâ€™s principle. Overall the homework was a decent tool in helping me solidify everything I have learned thus far in CSE 427 taught by Professor Neumann. I think I will tell other people to do this homework as well for it will benefit them, hopefully, as much as it has benefited myself.
