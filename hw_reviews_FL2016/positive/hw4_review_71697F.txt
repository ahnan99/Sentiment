I liked this homework because I felt like I was getting solid hands on experience. It was also cool seeing that we could alter the settings to change the results into something I could conceivably use. For example, in this lab, we were able to set an option to look at both case sensitive and insensitive values. This extra data could be useful for natural language processing and other pursuits
