This homework was enjoyable and I felt that is was a good piece of work to do. I learned a lot about pig and scripting in general with pig latin syntax and I became very comfortable analyzing different forms and types of data using the pig language. This homework taught me very much, and I certainly feel it was a terribly wonderful assignment regardless and in spite of the difficulty and how hard it was. It was very good in that it taught me so many skills and make me learn many things about pig and how to complete scripting jobs on data. This assignment was productive also. I was able to extract specific information for the ad companies from the specific data, and it was very useful for them. I hope for many more wonderful assignments such as this, that will teach me new skills and valuable and useful skills and tools at that.
