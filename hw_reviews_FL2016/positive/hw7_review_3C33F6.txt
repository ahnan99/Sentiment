I found this homework to be very challenging but also rewarding. I wonder if we will receive homework solutions at any point in time, which would make studying much easier and review of difficult concepts much more rewarding as well. I definitely enjoyed doing this homework despite the difficulty in completing it. I look forward to more homeworks like it.
