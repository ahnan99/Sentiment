I thought this assignmnet was fair and unambiguous given our level 
of learning in the class so far. I was fine doing the assignment and
I didn't struggle that often, though the assignment did take an annoyingly
long amount of time. The assignment made me feel glad though when I was
able to solve problems in it. Maybe if I did it again, I would not find
the length of the assignment so tedious because I would be able to
solve the problems so much faster. That would make me very very happy. The work
did make me feel very happy and not sad very often while I was doing it as well.Maybe I did enjoy this assignment very very much. I am very happy just thinking
about doing this work again and again.
