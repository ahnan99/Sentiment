Overall the homework went really well. I learned a lot. I had to work through a couple of bugs in problem two but once I got through that, the rest of the homework went smoothly. I think that one question I really didn't like was in the first question 1d I felt like it was asking whether it was less bad to use more space or more time in hadoop and that wasnt really something that we talked about. I think I figured it out though. Overall everything else was good!
