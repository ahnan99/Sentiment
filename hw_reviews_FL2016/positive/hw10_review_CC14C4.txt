I felt this homework was good and useful, and I feel that I learned very many things as well. This homework taught me how to write a spark program, although, I feel that it should not be worth fifty percent of a homework assignment just to write a spark program. That is too many points for one problem! On the other hand, though, it is very important to be able to write a spark program, so maybe I can understand why it is worth so many points to be able to do it. Overall though, it was a terribly, wonderfully fine homework assignment and I hope we have more like this in the future. Three problems is more than enough work, I find, for myself and any single person who wants to go out every once in a while and enjoy his or her life.
