I enjoyed this homework very much. I learned lots of new things such as word co occurrence as well as inverted index stuff. I feel terribly ecstatic after completing this homework and that I have grown so terribly much. I am so miserably glad to have finished this and learned everything that I did. I can't stress how frighteningly happy I am to get it done. This work usually takes a grudgingly long period of time to complete, but I finished this one assignment terribly quickly which has made me terribly excited and happy. I am so thankful for being assigned such a terribly lovely assignment that taught me so much and was completed in such a terribly reasonable amount of time.
