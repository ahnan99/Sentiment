This home work was a good experience for me. The first two questions were really easy and straightforward. I wish that 3rd 	question would have been a little more specific about what I needed to do (given me an input to use) the 4th question was also pretty straightforward, but what I was supposed to screen shot was a little condusing for questions 3 and 4. DOing numbber three helped me to learn the most of all of the questions. I think this homework, like all of the others helped me to understand the concepts much better than before
