I enjoyed this lab more than others because it was mostly coding and not so much about answering questions.
The coding was relatively simple but I wish I had thought about testing on something other than the Shakespeare data because the Shakespeare data took 10 or so minutes to MapReduce.
The extra credit also doesn't make that much sense to me, I ran into a lot of problems and errors that seemed to be unrelated to MapReduce.
