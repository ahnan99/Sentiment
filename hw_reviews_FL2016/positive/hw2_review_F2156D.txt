Overall this homework took a really long time. I really liked the second and third questions as it helped me to think about the stuff that we have been learning in class. The fourth question took a little longer beccause I couldn't figure out how to get it to run. On the first question for the third part it would have been nice if that information would have been somewhere else than just when it was said in class. overall this homework went well and I learend a lot
