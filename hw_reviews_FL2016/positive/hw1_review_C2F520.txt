I liked question 1, because it was a good review of the material we went over in class, in a method
that was familiar to us.
I enjoyed working through problem 2, but the lack of consistency with my equation that I derived and
the answers given at first was a bit frustrating.
Problem three was much more abstract that problem 2, and it led to a lot of discussion between my
partner and I on how to answer each of the three parts.
