I reallly enjoyed this homework. I learned a lot of things and information about the hadoop distributed file system. I learned mainly how to run programs locally. I feel that it is fairly useful to know this info because later on I will probably need to run many programs locally before I can run them on the hadoop cluster. I oftentimes felt that this homework was not good though. Sometimes I had errors or problems in the homework and the ta's were not really capable of helping me figure out my problems because they themselves did not know how to solve myproblems. That was bad with this homework and that is detracting from the positive aspects of the homework which is a good thing and a bad thing. This homework was good though indeed, if only because of the first things I mentioned. All I am saying is that it could certainly, no doubt in my mind, have been put together a little better with more knowledgeable tas with more hours at more convenient times. But I would like to thank this homework anyway for teaching me some things and teaching me that I can not rely on tas for help with this homework as it is so complext that they often do not know how to solve it.
