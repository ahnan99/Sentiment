This was a really fun assignment! Maybe it's only because
it was much shorter and easier than expected, but I
enjoyed it, and I can see this being useful practice for
the upcoming exams. I'm also very glad that we get stubs
to start our code off with; it made coding really easy
(almost a matter of copy-paste from the wordcount example).
I'm sure I would have a much harder time otherwise.
