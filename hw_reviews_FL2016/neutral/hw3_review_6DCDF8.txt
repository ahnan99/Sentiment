This homework was a little confusing--I had a hard time recalling
some of the things mentioned in the instructions. It would be nice
to focus on some of these things in lecture instead of just relying
on homeworks to fill in the gaps. But oh well. I will probably fail
these exams. Wish we only had HWs and no exams. But oh well.
