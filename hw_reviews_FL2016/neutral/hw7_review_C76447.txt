I think that this homework was one of the harder questions because there was very little information on how to complete the questions in the slides. I was not quite sure if there was more than one right way to do the matrix vector multiplication, but I came to the best solution that I could. For the third problem, it helped me to think conceptually about the problem much more easily. I did learn a lot from this homework, it just took a lot longer than it normally does.
