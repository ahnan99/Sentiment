I thought this homework was alright. I enjoyed the first problem because it gave us
more practice with things we worked on in class--further reinforcement is always a good
thing especially when it seems likely to occur on the exam. I found the second problem
to be straightforwrad at first once I understood the derivation for d = 2, p = 2 in
the book. However, it was really frustrating that none of the values we computed for the
other inputs worked according to the table in the instructions. That probably caused me to
bang my head on a wall and stare at that problem for too long. Finally, I thought the
reading for the last question was interesting but difficult to read. I had to look up a lot
of the vocabulary used because it was more specialized (to me at least) than "regular"
computer science jargon. In addition, that section about Semantic Web felt incredibly random
and did not make any sense in the context of the rest of the article--poorly done. Overall,
I "liked" the hw, and I wish the future assignments would be like this, but who am I kidding?
