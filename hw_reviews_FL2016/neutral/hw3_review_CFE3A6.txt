I thought that this homework was more redundant than the others. It had a lot of intersection with the lab than other homeworks. I suppose it made me learn better, though, because it helped reinforce concepts and practices that I was weak on. I think, next time, I will study more and be more prepared to do the homework and spend more time yee.
