This homework was deceptively easy. I thought it would be harder
but you were right when you said that it only takes a few lines
of code to deal with Sequence Files in a MapReduce job. For some
reason, I had a brain fart with this homework and had to look
everything up for every problem even though I supposedly studied
all of this for the exam. Whelp.
