This hw had a lot of typos. It made things very difficult.
In addition, some of the wording on the problems was very
confusing and we weren't sure what the question was driving
at. "Inevitable"? Really? Also, I wish we had a lab on writing
partitioners; it'd be nice to get labs for everything that will
be on exams or on homeworks just for extra practice.
