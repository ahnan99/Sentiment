Once again, I learned a lot from this homework. The only complaint that I have is that to test the test log data locally I couldnt use the hadoop file path, so I had to figure out how to unzip the file locally which want't that bad but it would have been a lot easier if I had been told I would have to do it. Another thing about this homework is that when you say "What do you notice" or something along those lines, it would really help if I knew what I was looking for. Sometimes I dont notice anything and sometimes i notice multiple things and I dont know which to put.
