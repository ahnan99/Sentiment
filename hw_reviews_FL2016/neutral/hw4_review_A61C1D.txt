Somehow this felt long and tedious yet not long and tedious.
Hm. I didn't understand the point of that one question
that almost sounded like an exact copy of a question we had
on the previos hw (hw3). It would be nice to get the feedback
quicker if we have to do things like that, but I know TAs
are busy. Because I'm busy too. Weekly homeworks are, not
gonna lie, a wee bit stressful.
