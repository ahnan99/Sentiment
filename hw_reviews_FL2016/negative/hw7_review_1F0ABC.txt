This homework felt a lot more taxing than the rest but overall took about the same amount of time.  The answers seemed difficult to get for #1 and #3.  Also the first problem, second part felt like mostly copy and pasting.
Overall this homework wasn't the worst but was definitely not the best.  I'd say around 1/3 worst.
