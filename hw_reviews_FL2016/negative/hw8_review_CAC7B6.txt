I did not like doing this homework so much. Not to say this was a bad assignment. The thing is, I did not have enough time, so I felt the assignment was too long and time consuming. It made my life tough and unfortunately I was not even able to learn that much wonderful and useful information from the work. I spent time on it indeed, but given how far behind I was on it, I could not seem to learn anything from the assignment or pick up any valuable information or skills. I hope in the future I have a lot lot more time to work on assignments and school work and that I can learn a lot more from assignments like these.
