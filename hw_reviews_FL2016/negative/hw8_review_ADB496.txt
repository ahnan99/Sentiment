I think one of the hardest parts about this homework was the graph.  I didn't really enjoy that we had to do that.  I wasn't really sure how to go about doing it and I felt like knowing how to graph it didn't increase my knowledge of the subject.  While the graph was helpful visually, it was unfair to not give me commands to make it.  Without my partner the graph would have taken me the most time to figure out how to do I think.
