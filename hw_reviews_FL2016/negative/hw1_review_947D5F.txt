The first question felt overly tedious.  It was difficult to explain my rationale because half of the time it just felt like a gut feeling.
Number two was difficult to complete until I started using an excel spreadsheet with equations.  After that, it became much easier to tinker around with specific parts of equations and easier to identify where I was incorrect since I knew that the first two parts of the equation should be increasing and the last should be decreasing.
For number 3, the article seemed awkwardly structured and somewhat frustrating.  However, the material it present was interesting and showed the necessity of big data.
