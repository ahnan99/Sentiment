This was a homework assignment that I did not enjoy so much. I felt that it was too hard and very arduous and I did not learn so many things. For one, it took too much time, and I was very tired while I did this assignment which made things much more tough and hard to understand. When I do a homework assignment I like to know what is happening at every point in the process, but here I did not feel that I could do that. There was not enough hand holding, and I certainly feel that hand holding is the best way to learn many things. One of those things is homework in cloud computing applications classes. I hope in the future that there will be more step by step processes so that I can learn the material much much better because I will need this information for future use. Therefore, please, I implore you! Make the homework assignments have more directions and step by step rules to follow. With this manner, I will be able to learn and understand the material in a satisfactory manner and I will thrive in the future and do very well on all my assignments and all my tests and exams.
