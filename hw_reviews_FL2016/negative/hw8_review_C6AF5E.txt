This homework was so hard compared to the other ones so far. The first
problem took so long to do because it was two map reduce jobs. That
wasn't really too hard but I kept making dumb mistakes that made life
difficult. The second problem was kind of hard if only because it seemed
like all the info for the answers was in the book rather than in the slides.
I also had to read a different chapter than the ones assigned for this
unit which was annoying. The last problem was stupidly annoying because of
the wording. I felt like we didn't talk at all about item-item similarity
so why was it saying "for all pairs of movies"? Ugh.
