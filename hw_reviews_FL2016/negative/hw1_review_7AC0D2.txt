HW1 was a relatively simple assignment to complete once a lot of the underlying terms could be understood. Some of them were initially very complicated or confusing (ex. semantic in web vs. semantic in interpretation). Overall, I would say it was an easy assignment. Question 2 was a little confusing as well.
