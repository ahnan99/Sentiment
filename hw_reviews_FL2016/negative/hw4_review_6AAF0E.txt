I though that this homework assignment took a long time and we did not learn enough in class about how to do it. It was time consuming mostly because we did not learn how to run through the specific steps we needed to run through when we were working on the assignment. That is why this work was not fun nor productive. Although we did learn how to execute toolrunner and run our work locally and test it locally and study many other things, which were indeed all very useful and wonderful and helpful and productive in learning how to run programs in mapreduce as well as create them, it was not time well spent. We could have just learned the steps to do all this and we would have finished so quickly and we would have learned just as much as we did doing this work and spending all of this long long time on it. I hope in future assignments and especially in the work for next week due on MOnday, we will have more guidance and help and aid with steps and walkthroughs and tutorials so we can learn more more quickly and complete the assignment quicker and more productively. In summary, this assignment was not that helpful and was way too time consuming.I can not reiterate this enough: make sure that there is more help and online tools that we can use when doing assignments so we can refer to them and speed through the assignments. I love it when I can work through work very fast. This could have been done in that way.
