This home work felt long and tedious. While it only took my partner and I about
4.5 hours to do--even after we had to read everything and look things up
in the book or slides--(and this is our normal amount of time), it just felt
so freaking long because of the multiple parts. Thank god some of the answers
were right in the slides to basically copy-paste. Also, I am so glad we didn't
have any coding to do; those matrix operations would have been complete shit
to have to do.
