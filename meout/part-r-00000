review	1	neutral	 Homework is relatively easier than the later ones I suppose I think it is a good way for starting chewing on the materials of big data The first question is really great exercise to get a deep understanding of the properties of the data But it is tough for me to do so many probability calculation and read a very long paper 
review	2	positive	 Homework two is not so hard I just need to read the textbook to get the knowledge of the HDFS And MapReduce is easier to understand by doing the last two questions I took much more less time to finish homework two than homework one It is a relief after doing such homework writing 
review	3	negative	 Homework three is not so hard I just need to read the textbook to get the knowledge of the HDFS But I m a little disappointed since homework three is still just requires writing I m looking forward to more practical problems like programming a real mapper or  reducer Fortunately it will come next time 
review	4	positive	 Finally we get a practical coding homework It is much fun dancing with codes instead of just writing answers It is helpful for me to understand more about the Partitioner and ToolRunner Though it takes more time to finish this homework I m still glad to do more programming This is certainly an important start for this course 
review	5	neutral	 It is fair to say homework is easier than the former one There still are many coding tasks but this time we need to build a MapReduce job from the beginning It is important because we finally start creating our own jobs But now I am starting to worry about the closing exam 
review	6	negative	 Homework is really a tough job for me It took me almost three hours to finish the first problem And the virtual machine crushed for several times when I was working on it The accidental exit of the virtual machine will make the history of the command lines disappear which is disappointing I must make the snapshot in case something is going wrong 
review	7	positive	 Homework dues two week after assigned which made me think that it requires a lot of work But fortunately there are not many coding tasks Instead it includes some conceptual questions and math computation problems The last problem is really good for us to understand the process of collaborative filtering without actually implementing it I m still not sure my answers are right for this one 
review	8	positive	 Homework requires less work than the previous one It is just some exploration on Spark But it do help us understand the functionality of Spark It is more user friendly than hadoop and do jobs much more faster Though it is a little tricky for programming with python since I did not use this language before it is a great experience for me to do this homework 
review	9	neutral	 Homework contains plenty problems Though it dues longer than others I must first review the materials for the exam When I start looking at it I have to look up to the slides two weeks ago to get everything clear It took me almost a whole day to finish it But it is a great help for understanding the usage of pig and the algorithm of Pagerank
