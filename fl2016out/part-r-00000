0513A4	5	positive	 I think this was a great opportunity to get more hands on work with the hadoop file system I think I am beginning to understand how to create these map reduce programs without as much hand holding I think I may even try to implement my own if I need to process large amounts of data
0C0D7E	7	neutral	 This homework was a bit different from the past few we ve been doing Matrices aren t something I usally enjoy doing so some of the problems took a bit longer than I expected especially the parts with the matrix multiplications and calculating efficient multiplication on problem  It was nice that the homework was conceptual since I wasn t sure I had a great grasp of the materials until I finished the homework 
0C3247	1	neutral	 I thought this homework was alright I enjoyed the first problem because it gave us more practice with things we worked on in class further reinforcement is always a good thing especially when it seems likely to occur on the exam I found the second problem to be straightforwrad at first once I understood the derivation for d p in the book However it was really frustrating that none of the values we computed for the other inputs worked according to the table in the instructions That probably caused me to bang my head on a wall and stare at that problem for too long Finally I thought the reading for the last question was interesting but difficult to read I had to look up a lot of the vocabulary used because it was more specialized to me at least than regular  computer science jargon In addition that section about Semantic Web felt incredibly random and did not make any sense in the context of the rest of the article poorly done Overall  I liked the hw and I wish the future assignments would be like this but who am I kidding 
10F867	5	neutral	 This hw had a lot of typos It made things very difficult  In addition some of the wording on the problems was very confusing and we weren t sure what the question was driving at Inevitable Really Also I wish we had a lab on writing partitioners it d be nice to get labs for everything that will be on exams or on homeworks just for extra practice 
1B4001	9	negative	 This was one wacky homework for the ages It was filled with all sorts of hijinks In reality it was pretty average I enjoyed it more than other homeworks because I did not have to decipher pages of mapreduce errors Writing mapreduce code is painful and it is not fun at all 
1BA5C6	4	positive	 The actual coding wasn t very difficult but it was difficult to run the code and figure out the exact command prompt commands I thought some of the questions were difficult to answer but the majority of them were relatively straight forward almost too simple Some of them felt like trick questions because they were so easy 
1F0ABC	7	negative	 This homework felt a lot more taxing than the rest but overall took about the same amount of time The answers seemed difficult to get for and Also the first problem second part felt like mostly copy and pasting  Overall this homework wasn t the worst but was definitely not the best I d say around  worst 
254A0C	10	positive	 This was my favorite homework yet I really enjoyed being apply to use my preferred language and a new framework for processing data I definitely think spark is the best thing we ve used so far and I look forward to using it again in the future I highly recommend that you retain this homework for future semesters 
3630AA	7	negative	 This home work felt long and tedious While it only took my partner and I about  hours to do even after we had to read everything and look things up in the book or slides and this is our normal amount of time it just felt so freaking long because of the multiple parts Thank god some of the answers were right in the slides to basically copy paste Also I am so glad we didn t have any coding to do those matrix operations would have been complete shit to have to do 
3829F6	8	neutral	 The problems concerning the collaborative filtering was fairly confusing for a while as we struggled with which algorithm to use and to correctly derive the Pearson from cosine   The last question s wording was particularly confusing since in class we had gone over based on comparing two users and it too a little bit of time to change our mindset to compare the similarity of the movies 
3894F5	1	neutral	 I thought the first problem in the homework was straightforward It was similar to what we did in class For that reason I did not think it was too difficult The second problem was more challenging to me The third problem was easier although the article it was based on seemed somewhat complex 
3C33F6	7	positive	 I found this homework to be very challenging but also rewarding I wonder if we will receive homework solutions at any point in time which would make studying much easier and review of difficult concepts much more rewarding as well I definitely enjoyed doing this homework despite the difficulty in completing it I look forward to more homeworks like it 
459EBD	2	positive	 I thought this assignmnet was fair and unambiguous given our level  of learning in the class so far I was fine doing the assignment and I didn t struggle that often though the assignment did take an annoyingly long amount of time The assignment made me feel glad though when I was able to solve problems in it Maybe if I did it again I would not find the length of the assignment so tedious because I would be able to solve the problems so much faster That would make me very very happy The work did make me feel very happy and not sad very often while I was doing it as well Maybe I did enjoy this assignment very very much I am very happy just thinking about doing this work again and again 
4DBE00	5	negative	 This was a homework assignment that I did not enjoy so much I felt that it was too hard and very arduous and I did not learn so many things For one it took too much time and I was very tired while I did this assignment which made things much more tough and hard to understand When I do a homework assignment I like to know what is happening at every point in the process but here I did not feel that I could do that There was not enough hand holding and I certainly feel that hand holding is the best way to learn many things One of those things is homework in cloud computing applications classes I hope in the future that there will be more step by step processes so that I can learn the material much much better because I will need this information for future use Therefore please I implore you Make the homework assignments have more directions and step by step rules to follow With this manner I will be able to learn and understand the material in a satisfactory manner and I will thrive in the future and do very well on all my assignments and all my tests and exams 
4E15C1	4	neutral	 This homework was interesting I found it relatively neutral in terms of difficulty It was easy to complete but rather long This will probably be useless for your sentiment analysis because I found it so neutral I look forward to completing additional work using the skills I learned in this homework 
55249B	7	positive	 Test I think there were quite a few tricky concepts in this homework which was good that we got to practice them and see how the matrix multiplication applied in an actual problem with actual values This was different because there were also problems from the book It was different from the other homeworks which were mainly implementation 
582149	5	neutral	 This was an average homework It was not fun I thought question two the sentiment analysis stuff was interesting though Like the previous homework we encountered small issues that were difficult to debug Here are some words that come to mind when thinking about the homework repetitive average difficult 
5F9D7D	3	positive	 I enjoyed this homework a lot Learning how to run MR jobs on my local machine was a really cool thing and learning how to unit test those instances of MR jobs is a really good tool to know I thought that some of the assignment was poorly worded but it happens 
608B84	10	neutral	 This homework honestly was not that bad The actual implementation was fine for part My partner and I split up the work this time instead of working together as we usually do I also had less time and was less focused on the homework because of thanksgiving Yay for turkey 
65CC4D	2	positive	 This homework was a lot more interesting because I felt like I was actually using Hadoop We coded a simple program and also talked a good amount about the process of the Hadoop system  Actually having to use terminal and the Linux VM also seemed to be more relevant to my education 
65F9D8	6	negative	 This homework went well I learned a lot from it as usual The questions all basically made sense There were again some times when I was not really sure how to answer the questions that asked what I noticed about the differences I know this homework was a two week assignment but I felt like it had a lot of coding problems involved with it Otherwise it did go well and I did learn a lot 
695F12	10	neutral	 This is a review that I will use for my submission I finished this homework after eating food with my family it was Thanksgiving Fifty words is a lot of words but sentiment analysis really needs adjectives Here are some adjectives bodacious radical awesome neat pythonic I will read this for my final project maybe 
6A1F98	10	negative	 This homework was annoying like every other homeowork it seems  I wonder why that is The most annoying thing about this homework was that you could not access the Spark UI for the last question unless the job was still running Once it finished Firefox could no longer access the server what 
6AAF0E	4	negative	 I though that this homework assignment took a long time and we did not learn enough in class about how to do it It was time consuming mostly because we did not learn how to run through the specific steps we needed to run through when we were working on the assignment That is why this work was not fun nor productive Although we did learn how to execute toolrunner and run our work locally and test it locally and study many other things which were indeed all very useful and wonderful and helpful and productive in learning how to run programs in mapreduce as well as create them it was not time well spent We could have just learned the steps to do all this and we would have finished so quickly and we would have learned just as much as we did doing this work and spending all of this long long time on it I hope in future assignments and especially in the work for next week due on MOnday we will have more guidance and help and aid with steps and walkthroughs and tutorials so we can learn more more quickly and complete the assignment quicker and more productively In summary this assignment was not that helpful and was way too time consuming I can not reiterate this enough make sure that there is more help and online tools that we can use when doing assignments so we can refer to them and speed through the assignments I love it when I can work through work very fast This could have been done in that way 
6DCDF8	3	neutral	 This homework was a little confusing I had a hard time recalling some of the things mentioned in the instructions It would be nice to focus on some of these things in lecture instead of just relying on homeworks to fill in the gaps But oh well I will probably fail these exams Wish we only had HWs and no exams But oh well 
71697F	4	positive	 I liked this homework because I felt like I was getting solid hands on experience It was also cool seeing that we could alter the settings to change the results into something I could conceivably use For example in this lab we were able to set an option to look at both case sensitive and insensitive values This extra data could be useful for natural language processing and other pursuits
717387	5	neutral	 There were several typos in the homework instructions that made it difficult in completing our assignments  It would be great if typos like this could be fixed in the future to avoid small errors that cause a lot of headache  Otherwise the assignment wasn t terribly difficult reviewing the reading of files in java took longer than expected 
747330	5	positive	 Overall the homework went really well I learned a lot I had to work through a couple of bugs in problem two but once I got through that the rest of the homework went smoothly I think that one question I really didn t like was in the first question d I felt like it was asking whether it was less bad to use more space or more time in hadoop and that wasnt really something that we talked about I think I figured it out though Overall everything else was good  
7894B0	6	positive	 I enjoyed this homework very much I learned lots of new things such as word co occurrence as well as inverted index stuff I feel terribly ecstatic after completing this homework and that I have grown so terribly much I am so miserably glad to have finished this and learned everything that I did I can t stress how frighteningly happy I am to get it done This work usually takes a grudgingly long period of time to complete but I finished this one assignment terribly quickly which has made me terribly excited and happy I am so thankful for being assigned such a terribly lovely assignment that taught me so much and was completed in such a terribly reasonable amount of time 
7AC0D2	1	negative	 HW was a relatively simple assignment to complete once a lot of the underlying terms could be understood Some of them were initially very complicated or confusing ex semantic in web vs semantic in interpretation Overall I would say it was an easy assignment Question was a little confusing as well 
7EC9CA	4	positive	 The hw was fairly straightforward when I understood the directions I had a lot of trouble with the initial implementation of ToolRunner because of a simple error where I used Job job new Job rather than the correct line of Job jo new Job getConf  The second one was interesting as well 
7FC1B8	6	positive	 I wish i had more time to spend on this homework It was decently fun as most homeworks in this class are I was unable to spend time on this assignment because I went to global hack this weekend which was my first hackathon It was very fun but I wish i was able to utilize big data in my project 
80E078	10	neutral	 This homework was confusing at times with the wording Problem and were fairly simple once we became used to writing and running code in SparkContext Dealing with XML was confusing at times because I had never worked on XML before  Problem was confusing at times since we often ran into errors in our very first time writing a spark program 
818434	8	negative	 Overall this homework went well it took me a while to figure out how to graph the data in the first problem but that was probably the biggest hurdle that I faced in the Homework I learned a lot from this assignment and I understand reccomendation systems a lot better because of it 
850AF1	3	positive	 I reallly enjoyed this homework I learned a lot of things and information about the hadoop distributed file system I learned mainly how to run programs locally I feel that it is fairly useful to know this info because later on I will probably need to run many programs locally before I can run them on the hadoop cluster I oftentimes felt that this homework was not good though Sometimes I had errors or problems in the homework and the ta s were not really capable of helping me figure out my problems because they themselves did not know how to solve myproblems That was bad with this homework and that is detracting from the positive aspects of the homework which is a good thing and a bad thing This homework was good though indeed if only because of the first things I mentioned All I am saying is that it could certainly no doubt in my mind have been put together a little better with more knowledgeable tas with more hours at more convenient times But I would like to thank this homework anyway for teaching me some things and teaching me that I can not rely on tas for help with this homework as it is so complext that they often do not know how to solve it 
89B222	1	positive	 I thought that this homework assignment was a good way to start the year It reinforced some concepts we learned in class and also had some mathematical elements too so we can get back in the swing of things It also introduced new information that showed the application of big data in novel ways All in all I think it was a positive way to start the semester The difficulty was not absurd either 
8B414B	9	negative	 Overall this homework went pretty well It took me a while to figure out that I needed a regular expression to get the script to access both files at once but after I figured it out it went pretty fast I think that I learned a lot from the homeworks but I also think that the homeworks are getting pretty tedious and I dont think we should have one every week
8EB048	10	negative	 This homework was by far the hardest homework of the semester I ran into a lot of bugs with the programs not working corrextly in python bbut working is scala etc I did learn while I was doing this homework but I probably spent tripe the time on this homework that I normally spend 
91C085	3	positive	 This home work was a good experience for me The first two questions were really easy and straightforward I wish that rd question would have been a little more specific about what I needed to do given me an input to use the th question was also pretty straightforward but what I was supposed to screen shot was a little condusing for questions and DOing numbber three helped me to learn the most of all of the questions I think this homework like all of the others helped me to understand the concepts much better than before
9315A6	8	negative	 This was another fun homework that I really enjoyed This is a lie I actually did not enjoy it The third question was pretty painful Here are some more words that describe how I feel about the homework not fun less than fun homework Besides that it was an average homework 
947D5F	1	negative	 The first question felt overly tedious It was difficult to explain my rationale because half of the time it just felt like a gut feeling  Number two was difficult to complete until I started using an excel spreadsheet with equations After that it became much easier to tinker around with specific parts of equations and easier to identify where I was incorrect since I knew that the first two parts of the equation should be increasing and the last should be decreasing  For number the article seemed awkwardly structured and somewhat frustrating However the material it present was interesting and showed the necessity of big data 
9E041A	9	positive	 I thought this homework was fun I had a good time doing it Pig is much better than map reduce Map reduce was tedious to write Pig is very fun and very fast However it is annoying not having a nice IDE to detect syntax errors and the error messages are not helpful
A3207F	8	neutral	 I thought this homework was fine It was cool to deal with real data from netflix and manipulate it I also had fun writing a short script to plot out the points using matplot lib ly To be honest it was a little tedious to do because of the weekly recurrence of these homeworks
A4AE3B	6	positive	 I enjoyed this lab more than others because it was mostly coding and not so much about answering questions  The coding was relatively simple but I wish I had thought about testing on something other than the Shakespeare data because the Shakespeare data took or so minutes to MapReduce  The extra credit also doesn t make that much sense to me I ran into a lot of problems and errors that seemed to be unrelated to MapReduce 
A61C1D	4	neutral	 Somehow this felt long and tedious yet not long and tedious  Hm I didn t understand the point of that one question that almost sounded like an exact copy of a question we had on the previos hw hw It would be nice to get the feedback quicker if we have to do things like that but I know TAs are busy Because I m busy too Weekly homeworks are not gonna lie a wee bit stressful 
A726AC	3	positive	 I found homework confusing at times because I wasn t certain about the direction certain questions were asking of us  The lab definitely helped in the completion of problem and problem I needed to read the book for certain answers of the book but that was to be expected 
A7505A	9	negative	 This was by far the most ambiguously worded homework assignment Prof Neumann has given to us My partner and I made judgement calls on what were supposed to do for literally every single problem That said this was the shortest assignment we have had since hw Pig is somewhat annoying to use 
ACACD7	6	negative	 Hello friends once again I am writing a review with very few adjectives This is a review with very few good or bad words Actually I changed my mind This homework was pretty awful I will continue to write some words that come to mind vague danimals two faced xylophone harsh 
ADB496	8	negative	 I think one of the hardest parts about this homework was the graph I didn t really enjoy that we had to do that I wasn t really sure how to go about doing it and I felt like knowing how to graph it didn t increase my knowledge of the subject While the graph was helpful visually it was unfair to not give me commands to make it Without my partner the graph would have taken me the most time to figure out how to do I think 
B094AD	9	negative	 This homework was worded fairly vaguely I wish we had better clarification on parts of the homework instructions such as in part c of problem where I wasn t sure whether the new relation that counts for the total number of clicks on the site was to be created from the original data or the filtered data we created earlier in part c 
B3C993	7	positive	 I enjoyed this work very much I learned a lot about matrices and very much about math in general and how matrices work in tandem with big data and map reduce functions It felt very good learning all this information especially because it was not hard material and it will certainly prove very useful and powerful in the future when I use mapreduce and execute more jobs with it So in conclusions this was indeed a very good and worthwhile homework assignment because it taught me so many useful skills and tools that I can now use and implement in the future I also liked this work because it was conceptual and kind of abstract and as a math major this is the sort of thinking I like to do 
B5A155	4	neutral	 Once again I learned a lot from this homework The only complaint that I have is that to test the test log data locally I couldnt use the hadoop file path so I had to figure out how to unzip the file locally which want t that bad but it would have been a lot easier if I had been told I would have to do it Another thing about this homework is that when you say What do you notice or something along those lines it would really help if I knew what I was looking for Sometimes I dont notice anything and sometimes i notice multiple things and I dont know which to put 
B95CA9	2	neutral	 This was a really fun assignment Maybe it s only because it was much shorter and easier than expected but I enjoyed it and I can see this being useful practice for the upcoming exams I m also very glad that we get stubs to start our code off with it made coding really easy  almost a matter of copy paste from the wordcount example  I m sure I would have a much harder time otherwise 
C2F520	1	positive	 I liked question because it was a good review of the material we went over in class in a method that was familiar to us  I enjoyed working through problem but the lack of consistency with my equation that I derived and the answers given at first was a bit frustrating  Problem three was much more abstract that problem and it led to a lot of discussion between my partner and I on how to answer each of the three parts 
C6AF5E	8	negative	 This homework was so hard compared to the other ones so far The first problem took so long to do because it was two map reduce jobs That wasn t really too hard but I kept making dumb mistakes that made life difficult The second problem was kind of hard if only because it seemed like all the info for the answers was in the book rather than in the slides  I also had to read a different chapter than the ones assigned for this unit which was annoying The last problem was stupidly annoying because of the wording I felt like we didn t talk at all about item item similarity so why was it saying for all pairs of movies Ugh 
C70FAB	3	negative	 This homework was more difficult than the others Some of the questions seemed ambigious and unguided which made answering them very difficult because it was hard to know what was the expected answer  I guess the homework challenged me in different ways and forced me to really understand some of the concepts so that s good 
C76447	7	neutral	 I think that this homework was one of the harder questions because there was very little information on how to complete the questions in the slides I was not quite sure if there was more than one right way to do the matrix vector multiplication but I came to the best solution that I could For the third problem it helped me to think conceptually about the problem much more easily I did learn a lot from this homework it just took a lot longer than it normally does 
CAC7B6	8	negative	 I did not like doing this homework so much Not to say this was a bad assignment The thing is I did not have enough time so I felt the assignment was too long and time consuming It made my life tough and unfortunately I was not even able to learn that much wonderful and useful information from the work I spent time on it indeed but given how far behind I was on it I could not seem to learn anything from the assignment or pick up any valuable information or skills I hope in the future I have a lot lot more time to work on assignments and school work and that I can learn a lot more from assignments like these 
CC14C4	10	positive	 I felt this homework was good and useful and I feel that I learned very many things as well This homework taught me how to write a spark program although I feel that it should not be worth fifty percent of a homework assignment just to write a spark program That is too many points for one problem On the other hand though it is very important to be able to write a spark program so maybe I can understand why it is worth so many points to be able to do it Overall though it was a terribly wonderfully fine homework assignment and I hope we have more like this in the future Three problems is more than enough work I find for myself and any single person who wants to go out every once in a while and enjoy his or her life 
CFE3A6	3	neutral	 I thought that this homework was more redundant than the others It had a lot of intersection with the lab than other homeworks I suppose it made me learn better though because it helped reinforce concepts and practices that I was weak on I think next time I will study more and be more prepared to do the homework and spend more time yee 
D23DB5	1	positive	 I learned a lot in this homework It helped me to understand different categories of big data and how to approach and observe big data I also got the chance to brush up on my math and probability skills in problem two where I got to derive a generic formula for evildoers based on a man s principle Overall the homework was a decent tool in helping me solidify everything I have learned thus far in CSE taught by Professor Neumann I think I will tell other people to do this homework as well for it will benefit them hopefully as much as it has benefited myself 
D36358	7	negative	 This homework was not fun I have no idea how to accurately find communication cost I am currently drinking water and writing a review with a lot of great adjectives It is terrible that it has to reach fifty non fun words For that reason I will include the following adjective for Halloween hallowed 
D4E133	2	positive	 I thought this assignment was extremely good for helping me understand what the HDFS commands are doing and how to actually create and execute my own MapReduce programs It is exciting to think about the possibilities I can apply this with if I can get my hands on data I think I am definitely a lot more comfortable with hadoop now and I know what I am doing 
D84A9A	0	neutral	 I thought this homework was a bit of a nuisance because it was coming off of Thanksgiving break Granted it was not too bad though because we were given extra time through the extension and it being due on Wednesday rather than Monday Overall  But yeah I had a neutral response 
E7611C	2	positive	 This assignment was very interesting I found that I was able to apply a lot of the command line knowledge I have acquired from years while doing it Piping HDFS output into standard Unix shell commands was pretty cool I look forward to seeing what the skills from this homework can be applied to in the future 
EC6D5E	6	neutral	 This homework was deceptively easy I thought it would be harder but you were right when you said that it only takes a few lines of code to deal with Sequence Files in a MapReduce job For some reason I had a brain fart with this homework and had to look everything up for every problem even though I supposedly studied all of this for the exam Whelp 
F1A4E4	9	positive	 This homework was one of the faster ones if not the fastest in the last homeworks I really enjoyed pig it was much simpler than I had thought it would be It was easy to use and even easier to test with It seems less specific as of right now since I don t know how to implement more specific functions 
F2156D	2	positive	 Overall this homework took a really long time I really liked the second and third questions as it helped me to think about the stuff that we have been learning in class The fourth question took a little longer beccause I couldn t figure out how to get it to run On the first question for the third part it would have been nice if that information would have been somewhere else than just when it was said in class overall this homework went well and I learend a lot 
F9B304	5	negative	 This homework was really frustrating because the STUB file wasn t exactly working and was a bit misleading The actual content of this homework was interesting but I ran into a bunch of problems with ToolRunner and a bunch of other unrelated things This homework also took a bit longer than usual but that s whatever 
FA2727	9	positive	 This homework was enjoyable and I felt that is was a good piece of work to do I learned a lot about pig and scripting in general with pig latin syntax and I became very comfortable analyzing different forms and types of data using the pig language This homework taught me very much and I certainly feel it was a terribly wonderful assignment regardless and in spite of the difficulty and how hard it was It was very good in that it taught me so many skills and make me learn many things about pig and how to complete scripting jobs on data This assignment was productive also I was able to extract specific information for the ad companies from the specific data and it was very useful for them I hope for many more wonderful assignments such as this that will teach me new skills and valuable and useful skills and tools at that
