F02EDF	6	positive	 thought 6 pretty fun despite fact busy week debilitating migraine majority thus ended up having rush hw6 done at minute an interesting challenge appreciated task implementing new types programs especially enjoyed inverted index sequence file boring didn involve solving 
F19801	7	negative	 way tougher previous reason didn studying textbook slides midterms other classes hard going back forward between contexts third page rank carefully delived didn know things simply studying lecture notes google thanks god finally completed during day spring break canada don like feeling doing when break 
F23AE2	7	negative	 done homework7 following review write up easy after read mmds section 5 5 easy solve debugged partner debugged several times well any relative programing knowledge co occurrence except google find 
F2EF83	4	negative	 takes significantly longer previous ones weekly although could just having partner at wish could even distribution throughout semesters better expectations at begining course particularly helpful real world applicaitons considering specific practical wish next could broken into two if long 
F35943	3	positive	 enjoyed especially third where write our own wasn challenge just looked at wordcount made modifications second helped reinforce sequence events yarn process sped through lecture 
F55CF7	1	positive	 reading material textbook lab work find good prctice knowledge learn course actually enjoy partership classmate works well discussion both learned 
F56E9F	9	positive	 found 9 pretty enjoyable prefer using python nice able implement at least pyspark otherwise pig repetitive seem tedious see s useful m happy start adding repetoire cs skills liked week project dualcore tied material into relevant real life applications overall 9 might been favorite yet ll see still left 
F59CB5	1	positive	 helps properties big especially difference between structured semi structured un structured mainly calculating probability after making mistakes finally make right article learning text interesting idea processing human language always an interesting topic 
F66563	6	positive	 during our work 6 endeavored complete customizing writable manipulation sequence files snappy along inverted indexing words set review content lecture correspondingly right difficulty workload enough long completed though necessary teach cloud computing works doesn require submit will helpful if early warning consumption 
F6F2F0	3	positive	 comprehensive practices programming basic explanations hadoop related basic statistics makes students efficiency second explanation related yarn makes student process execution third nice practices hope programming assignments will given future would nice if students could sets practice jobs limited word count sum good comprehensive answered 
F7F6DB	5	negative	 busy week wasn able turn frustrating realize couldn finish fast expected work until sunday morning finalize our results wanted improve when turned late next should definitely plan ahead started earlier 
F80DF7	6	negative	 frustrating felt like figure these things ourselves supposed learning experience little guidance given lecture slides many things implement seek stackoverflow like sequencefilewriter demo provided seemed outdated modifications made adapt its intended purpose 
F83D07	3	positive	 difficult previous ones due being little vague previously  third nothing lots thought figure at times frustrating end learned 
F89970	2	positive	 homeword consists schematic numerical subjective order complete need go through lab1 lab2 well lab slides introduction better doing homework1 getting closed hdfs makes excited 
F8A944	4	positive	 cloud computing practical technologies widely used daily life popularity cloud computing makes course important people even background actually hard interesting mainly includes aspects knowledge related cloud computing finished reviewing information book slides lab 
FB030E	2	positive	 enjoyed challenging enough work doable able complete most own good amount weekly hw opinion overall thought fair great learning experience 
FBC836	6	positive	 introduces further function process make process efficient good review lecture offers valuable coding experience gives deeper both concepts realize myself 
FC2DD4	4	positive	 4 overall interesting somewhat challenging helps solidify toolrunner configurations work hadoop well difference between running map reduce locally cluster good exercise java however could been worded better cause confusion provided little context certain terms mean 
FD3448	7	negative	 confusing especially second know he required two programs meaning takes such long through third relatively good give nice review lecture 
FDBED9	5	negative	 intersting professor newman teaches use combiner partitioner our hand combiners make process reduction efficient pre reduce keys less key pairs sending actual reducer other hand partitioner distributing blocks files reducer helps
